The ski area is enormous with over 5,289 acres to explore and four distinct base areas connected by free buses and heated walkways. It draws skiers from all over the world and provides excellent terrain for all ability levels.\r\nThe resort has great terrain options, excellent ski schools and a large assortment of shopping and dining options. The two main base areas are Vail Village and Lionshead. Vail Village located at the base of Gondola One is the original base area and is home to Vail&rsquo;s iconic covered bridge that crosses Gore Creek. Lionshead Village, located just west of Vail Village, is serviced by its own gondola and is home to luxury resorts.\r\nDenver to Vail is about 1.5 hours &ndash; or more depending on traffic. It is 100 miles from Denver International Airport and 30 miles east of Eagle County Regional Airport (EGE). There are plenty of shuttle services to Vail. Once you get to Vail, you can navigate the town by bus for free.\r\nVail is a great destination for many skiers, but the resort can get crowded on the weekends. So, check the chair lift status signs at strategic intersections on the mountain to avoid backups. A yellow light means the lift maze is full so choose an alternative route if possible. A green light means you are good to go. \r\nVail Ski Resort History\r\nWhile many other ski resorts in the western United States started as mining towns, Vail was built from the ground up to be a ski resort. During World War II the U.S. Army established a training center at Camp Hale located just 14 miles south of what would later become Vail Mountain. The U.S. Army&rsquo;s 10th Mountain Division trained at Camp Hale and consisted of excellent skiers and mountaineers that fought in the mountains of northern Italy during WWII. Upon their return from the war, they quickly became major players in the burgeoning ski industry.\r\nA veteran of the 10th Mountain Division, Pete Seibert returned to Colorado after the war to search for a perfect location to build a ski area in the Rocky Mountain region. Pete teamed up with friend Earl Eaton who led Pete on a seven-hour climb up a no-name mountain, where they crested the summit to discover the now legendary back bowls.",

Beginners, too, can take to the slopes at their own pace. If you just can't get your fill of skiing during the day, don't worry - there's lighted night skiing to fill the void.\r\nThe ski resort is located three hours from New York City and Boston, and an hour form Albany, New York, and Springfield, Massachusetts.

There are 41 runs, a vertical drop of 1,055 feet, average snowfall of 190 inches, and a snowmaking system that covers 70 percent of Sipapu's 200 acres. There's plenty of diversity in the terrain. You'll find some of the best tree skiing in the state, a couple of terrain parks, some long cruising trails, and an abundance of novice and beginner terrain. ",

        "description": "Thanksgiving Day, 2012, marks 75 years of making turns at Pico Mountain. In 1937 on Thanksgiving morning, Pico Mountain Ski Resort came to life with only a 1,200 foot rope tow powered by a Hudson motor car engine and a lot of love. Since then, a lot has changed. But the love that began more than seventy years ago for this mountain still lives today &ndash; and it&rsquo;s as strong as ever. No other big mountain has such small mountain charm, and no athletes love their mountain quite like Pico skiers and riders.\r\nFamilies and skiing traditionalists now enjoy 52 trails serviced by seven lifts, including two high-speed detachable quads. Gentle learning terrain, smooth cruisers and classically narrow New England steeps can all be found at Pico Mountain. Even the most selective skiers and riders will be impressed by Pico&rsquo;s vertical drop of 1,967&rsquo; &ndash; taller than 80% of Vermont ski areas.\r\nWhether you choose scenic glades or gentle, winding trails, Pico Mountain has it all. And, if you&rsquo;re willing, we can teach you how to enjoy it all. Our Snow Sports School offers specialized learning programs for everyone from children and first-timers to seasoned pros, all created with quality and value in mind.\r\n \r\n ",

The resort&rsquo;s strengths are long blue cruising runs that are impeccably groomed.\r\nStep out of your lodge room at 8:30 a.m. or in the evening after 6 p.m., and you&rsquo;re guaranteed to find miles of impeccably groomed, corduroy-like runs. What you won&rsquo;t find here is much knee-knocking steep, but kids love the several terrain parks scattered around the resort. Skiers give it high marks in the areas of service, lodging, dining and apr&egrave;s-ski activity; all the things that combine to make for a great family ski vacation.\r\nWith all the buildings connected by covered walkways, it&rsquo;s easy to get around. Mom and dad can enjoy a leisurely dinner in the upscale Cornucopia Room while the kids go safely off to eat pizza and play games in another part of the resort.\r\nLocated just three hours from Chicago, Illinois, and a little over half an hour from Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin, it&rsquo;s an easy drive from all these major metropolitan areas",

Have one before heading over to Corbett’s. The mandatory air to get into the famous Couloir is less intimidating on a full stomach.<br><br>If the ski weather report has said that there’s more snow at the top, it’s best to stick to the higher runs than the lower elevations. You can access this terrain from the top of the tram. With lessons for all ages and abilities, JHMR Mountain Sports School is awesome. Adults signing up for group lessons at intermediate levels and higher often end up with a semi-private lesson.<br><br>If you can tear yourself away from the mountain for a day off, Grand Teton National Park is literally right next to JHMR. Yellowstone National Park is about an hour away, and numerous outfitters in Jackson offer day-long snowmobile trips to Old Faithful, which is a much less touristy in winter.<br><br>Few resorts in the country can compete with JHMR. Twelve miles away, Snow King Resort is smart enough not to try. Jackson’s “town hill,” Snow King is still a local’s favorite. It offers ½ day passes, 400 skiable acres, 32 named runs night skiing, a tubing park and, from both mid-mountain and the summit, fantastic views of the Tetons. It is north facing so usually pretty chilly. Back at JHMR, the best views of Corbet’s Couloir - other than those heart-pounding looks you get standing at its lip - are from the southern deck at Couloir atop the Bridger Gondola.",

Do your skiing or riding thing across 3,000 acres from groomed cruisers to the Putnam Creek steeps and into the Silver Woods glades.\r\nSilver Star&rsquo;s village is reminiscent of a typical 19th century British Columbian mining town era with Victorian architecture. Boarded sidewalks and brightly colored shop fronts add a unique western flavor.\r\nAccommodations are ski-in, ski-out with condos and hotels. The Snowbird Lodge is luxurious and you also can enjoy some unique Victorian-style vacation homes.\r\nSilver Star averages more than 700 cm of snow annually (23 feet). There are 12 lifts, including a six-pack, four quads, a double, four surface lifts and two tube lifts. You'll ski or ride on 115 marked trails, the majority intermediate, but with plenty of beginner and advanced action.\r\nEnjoy cross-country skiing? Well, members of numerous national teams, including Canada and the U.S., will tell you Big White's Nordic trails are among their favorites.\r\nThe resort is 22 km (12 miles) from Vernon. Easiest bet from there is to take the Vernon Airporter to the mountain. Driving? Connect with Highway 97 to Vernon and follow 48th Ave. to Silver Star Road directly to the resort.

And with over 1200 m of vertical height, the challenges on offer are sufficient to get the best out of everyone. Snowshoe excursions by moonlight, torch-lit descents and a glass of vin chaud, local specialities (matouille, teillons). The Vall&eacute;e des Villards is a source of so many unforgettable memories. In addition, the upper reaches of the valley present a remarkably unspoilt natural environment, readily accessible to backcountry ski enthusiasts seeking the sense of freedom and exhilaration of a descent through deep, fresh powder.Ideal as a winter holiday location, the Vall&eacute;e des Villards is also the premier gateway into Les Sybelles - with 310 km of trails, now one of France's largest skiable areas.",

        "name": "Alpe d'Huez",
        "description": "Alpe d&rsquo;Huez (1,860-3330m) is a sizeable, modern resort known for its sunny, extensive terrain and spectacular views across the Southern Alps. The efficient lift system whisks you up to the vast, high-altitude ski area of the Alpe d&rsquo;Huez Grand Domain Ski (250km) with its wide choice of varied runs, well-suited to all levels.\r\nAlpe d&rsquo;Huez is one of the liveliest resorts in the French Alps, but is divided into separate quarters, so you can often find yourself far away from the centre (Avenue des Jeux). A good tip is to stay in the prettier, more rustic village of Vaujany, which is linked to Alpe d&rsquo;Huez by chairlift. Families are particularly fond of Alpe d&rsquo;Huez for its friendly, laid-back atmosphere and wide choice of accommodation &ndash; apartments, chalets, hotels and B&amp;Bs.\r\nThe ski area is comprised of five ski resorts and two traditional mountain villages: Alpe d&rsquo;Huez, Auris-en-Oisans, La Garde, Le Freney d&rsquo;Oisans, Oz-en-Oisans, Vaujany and Villard-Reculas.\r\nThe Mountain\r\nThe resort&rsquo;s efficient lift system whisks skiers up to the vast, high-altitude slopes of the Alpe d&rsquo;Huez Grand Domaine Ski (250km). Here you&rsquo;ll find a wealth of sunny, south-facing runs high above the treeline, suitable for all levels and dotted with plenty of good mountain restaurants.\r\nFew resorts can rival Alpe d&rsquo;Huez for size of ski area and variety of terrain, which is often compared to Espace Killy (Tignes and Val d&rsquo;Isere). In mid-winter Alpe d&rsquo;Huez&rsquo;s high-altitude slopes maintain great snow conditions, but the strong southern sun can mean late-season snow becomes slushy in the afternoon.\r\nMountain highlights include the 16km Sarenne piste (primarily black) which offers 1hr30 of uninterrupted skiing. There&rsquo;s also some serious off-piste, plenty of steep verticals, a varied snow park and one of the biggest nursery ski areas in the Alps.\r\nDownsides to the ski area are the few tree runs, which leaves few options on bad-weather days;  overcrowding is a regular occurrence on the Chamois and Coulior runs at the top of the DMC gondola; and late-season snow can alternate between slushy afternoons and icy mornings.\r\nFreeriding\r\nAlpe d&rsquo;Huez has some serious off-piste to explore. The extensive and varied terrain is particularly well-suited to the more adventurous freerider. You&rsquo;ll find more than 20 high-altitude, off-piste trails, with gullies and tracts of fresh powdered snow.  Some of the most popular off-piste powder can be found in areas such as Gorges de Sarenne and Glacier de Sarenne. Note: Always ride with a guide.\r\nOn the pistes\r\nBeginners: Alpe d&rsquo;Huez has one of the largest nursery areas in the Alps with four free lifts for beginners. The mass of green runs above the village (accessed by the Troncon cable car) and above the Les Bergers area (accessed by the Romains chair) offer plenty of wide, gentle slopes to help you find your snow legs. Although watch out for more advanced skiers whizzing through at the end of the day.\r\nIntermediates: A good selection of intermediate runs are spread throughout the ski area. Some of the most challenging reds can be found in the Villard-Reculas and Signal de l&rsquo;Homme sectors. Confident intermediates can try the Canyon run from Plat des Marmottes or the 16km Sarenne black run. For less confident intermediates, there are some great blue cruisers from the Signal sector heading down to Alpe d&rsquo;Huez, or try the sector the long, blue Champclotury run above Oz or the main Couloir blue from 2,700m.\r\nAdvanced/experts: The black, expert runs are accessible from the top of Pic Blanc and Les Marmottes III cable car. They attract thrill seekers and the more technically advanced skiers to experience the maximum vertical drop of 2,200m. Particularly noteworthy black runs include the Fare piste, the Combe Charbonniere, Balme, La Fuma and the Col de Cluy.\r\nThe legendary 16km black Sarenne piste stretches from Pic Blanc (3,330m) to Alpe d'Huez (1,860m). It consists of two sections: initially a fairly steep series of pitches which can get a bit mogulled and then a long flatter section along the valley. It is primarily a black ski run, but you can avoid the really steep section at the top by skiing off from the Marmottes 3 bubble instead. On a powder day, the run can take quite some time with waist-deep snow to wade through in the flatter section.\r\nPark/Pipe\r\nAlpe d&rsquo;Huez has two snowparks: the main (advanced) one, stretching down the side of the DMC, is praised for its design. You&rsquo;ll find everything from an easy beginner line to a big airbag jump, half-pipe (depending on snow conditions), a boardercross, and multitude of rails; the second, smaller park is for beginners (with a couple of kickers and some bumps) and is located above Vaujany.",

        "name": "Alpe du Grand Serre",
        "description": "At the entrance to the Oisans area of the Alps, you will find the ski resort of Alpe du Grand Serre. Perched on top of the 1368 metre high mountain pass leading from the Romanche to the Roizonne Valley, the town is over looked by the massive Taillefer and Grand Serre mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThe ski resort is made up of 6 hamlets (Désert, la Blache, Chabottel, La Cascade, Le Couvent and Jean-Poncet), 150 permanent inhabitants and nearly 700 holiday homes. To find the bottom of the slopes, the ticket desks and a good range of shops go to La Blache.\r\n\r\nA far cry from the crowded skiing of the larger resorts, Alpe du Grand Serre has it all with high altitude skiing offering 55 kilometres of marked ski slopes and an undulating wooded area with 20 kilometres of cross-country skiing tracks.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the Alpe du Grand Serre ski resort is invisible from the town itself and the lift and ski run network is well spread out amongst the Pérollier mountain range which rises up to 2184 metres in altitude. The 817 metres of vertical descent back to the resort (1367 m) is indeed an important factor in providing an overall pleasurable skiing experience, but it is ultimately the layout of the resort network itself that really makes the Alpe du Grand Serre stand out.\r\n\r\nThe ski runs are positioned around the peak of the Pérollier, offering skiing on each side of the mountain. This relatively unique set up in Europe allows the skier to choose their ski routes according to the sun throughout the day or the quality of the snow.\r\n\r\nThe ski area of the Alpe du Grand Serre is made up of a large majority of blue and red runs. The skiing is great for intermediate skiers looking to improve their technique, but also highly accessible to families of all kinds. It is also worth noting that there are two specially set-up areas at the bottom of La Blache which are great for children learning to ski.\r\n\r\nThe bonus: take a trip to the resorts of Oz en Oisans and Vaujany located in the Alpe d’Heuz ski area which are only 50 minutes away by car. If you are skiing at the Alpe du Grand Serre for at least 3 days, you can enjoy from the ski pass exchange program that the two ski areas have put in place.\r\n\r\nA mountain holiday doesn’t necessarily mean skiing and snowboarding; for those that prefer something a little different you can sure to enjoy yourself just as much on snowshoes, tobogganing or simply a walking through this beautiful setting with those who you love. \r\n\r\nThe ‘Club des intrépides’ welcomes children between 6 and 11 years old who have accomplished either their 2nd or 3rd level ski star. The team helps kids to gradually master skiing and ultimately prime them for eventual ski racing. The children are able to participate in group ski activities including basic slalom and as well as a chance to discover snowboarding.\r\n\r\nFor younger children, the nursery \"Les Bout'Choux\" welcomes children from 6 months to 6 years old throughout the winter season from 9am to 5pm every day (except Thursdays outside of the holiday periods). The nursery welcomes babies and organises themed activities such as fun in the snow, Eskimos, natural discovery, scientific discovery and outdoor games. The nursery works in partnership with the ESF (French Ski School) to offer ski lessons in the ‘Piou-Piou’ (Piwi-Piwi) Club.",

        "description": "At the heart of Beaufortain area of the Savoie, 25 km from Albertville, Arêches-Beaufort is a charming traditional ski village with a range of ski runs meandering through the forests that pass beside the beautiful wooden chalets, overlooked by the Mont Blanc. The resort also has plenty of natural ski areas for those budding off piste powder skiing enthusiasts. \r\n\r\nThe resort town of Arêches Beaufort is divided into two sectors: Le Grand Mont and Le Planay.\r\n\r\nThe resort offers exceptional snow fall covering the slopes which stretch from 1080 metres to 2300 metres in altitude. Arêches-Beaufort is a resort that should be considered by skiers of all abilities (55 km of ski runs). What with the Freestyle Snow Park, the Woodpark through to the Boarder Baby Cross and the large areas dedicated to free riding, there is definitely something for everyone! \r\n\r\nArêches-Beaufort doesn't leave out the Nordic skiers either. The cross country ski trails are spread over 3 sites: \r\n- Marcot-Beaufort: Easy skiing, on the edge of the Marcot forest. Skiing through the forest is a great way to get away from it all, and if you are just beginning the resort has flat trails, ideal for those just starting out. \r\n- Le Bersend: Don't leave without trying the easy cross country skiing trails in Le Bersend! The trails take skiers through the typical unspoiled alpine mountain villages and if you're lucky you'll have the chance to see some of the rich and varied local wildlife: deer, chamois, foxes, weasels to name but a few... \r\n- The plateau-Cuvy: At 1700 m high there is a 2 km long cross country ski trail (chairlift access from the Grand-Mont). \r\n\r\nFor those who choose to spend their holidays in Arêches Beaufort who don't necessarily ski, the resort offers a wide range of activities: snowshoe races, snow or ice races, horse and carriage rides, historical discovery (churches, Baroque trails ...), farm visits (cheese and wine shops produce the famous Beaufort cheese). \r\n\r\nIn Arêches Beaufort there are plenty of people willing to look after your children when you're off skiing: \r\n- Daycare \"Les Petites Frimousses\" in Planay (welcomes children from 18 months to 6 years old) \r\n- The nursery \"Galipette\" in Beaufort (12 places from 3 months to 6 years old)\r\n \r\nYou can also call the childminders who are certified by the Savoie department (about a dozen is the Arêches Beaufort ski resort).\r\n\r\nThe snow garden for children from 3 to 5 years old is a great place for young apprentice skiers to find their feet, making use of the specially designed easy access mini ski lift. The welcoming team offer a range of ski related games and supervised activities great for keeping the kids occupied throughout the day. \r\n\r\nArêches-Beaufort is well set up for children and offers a public snow garden (original Arêches-Beaufort concept) which is on the Plateau of Cuvy and accessed by the Grand Mont chairlift (open to pedestrians). The snow garden offers families with young children a place to play in safety whilst being outside and taking in the fabulous views. \r\n\r\nIn Arêches-Beaufort the real food connoisseurs will enjoy the local cuisine, the famous Beaufort cheese, the Grataron (goat cheese), the Pormonier (pork and vegetable sausage) or the Farçon (a dessert made with potatoes, prunes, figs and spices). These traditional local dishes are served in an array of restaurants found in the resort. ",

        "name": "Avoriaz",
        "description": "AVORIAZ is best for: Families, intermediates, freestylers\r\nHighlights: Car-free, sunny village with compact centre, ski-in/ski-out lodgings, shady snowsure slopes, great position on the Portes du Soleil circuit, leading resort for freestylers (five terrain parks and a super-pipe), plenty of good off-piste, access to the legendary Swiss Wall, and a renowned kids' club.\r\nNon-skiers: Aquariaz leisure pool, bowling, skating rink, dog sledding, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.\r\nNearest airports: Geneva (100km/1hr30), Chambery (145km/1hr50), Lyon (220km/2hr30). Nearest station: Cluses and Thonon-les-bains are both around 1 hour away by road\r\nSix-day ski pass: &euro;260Slap bang in the centre of the Portes du Soleil ski area, Avoriaz (1,800m) has access to some serious terrain &ndash; 650km to be exact. The local ski area ain't too shabby either with fast, modern lifts and high, snow-sure slopes receiving around eight metres of powder each winter. Avoriaz is also one of the French greats for freestylers &ndash; there are now five snowparks and a super-pipe.\r\nArchitecturally, Avoriaz is one of the more modern resorts in the Portes du Soleil but, in contrast, transportation around town is delightfully old fashioned. It is one of the few pedestrianized resorts in the Alps so you won't see any cars here; sleds, snowcats or horse-drawn sleighs are the only form of transport allowed, and skis of course &ndash; the resort&rsquo;s high-altitude means skiing back to your hotel is the norm. Avoriaz has a very narrow selection of hotels and restaurants, but just a lift ride away (with more choice) is the British favourite, Morzine.\r\nThe Mountain\r\nAvoriaz: 75.5km local slopes (650km Portes du Soleil)\r\nThe Portes du Soleil is one of the largest ski areas in the world, comprising 650km of slopes and 12 resorts. With a vast and varied choice of ski runs, the area offers endless possibilities, allowing you to cross the border into Switzerland.\r\nIn the heart of the Portes du Soleil sits Avoriaz &ndash; the highest resort in the area with the best snow conditions; its local ski slopes receive, on average, eight metres of powder each winter. The resort has lifts and pistes fanning out in all directions. Its closest slopes can appear a little bleak and tree-less, but they are fairly snow-sure and are served by fast, modern lifts. If you&rsquo;re heading out further afield, be warned the lifts beyond Chatel are outdated and slow.\r\nThere&rsquo;s plenty to satisfy all skiers in Avoriaz: long, gentle cruisers and highly acclaimed ski schools for families; five snowparks and a superpipe for freestylers; and the terrifying Swiss Wall, Olympic downhill and fast, technical off-piste routes for experts.\r\nThere are three off-piste runs that should not be missed on powder day: Vall&eacute;e de la manche &ndash; a 10km descent with dramatic views of the Mont Blanc; La Pointe de Vorlaz &ndash; a very fast and technical run; and the Swiss side of Mossette which starts with a narrow passage before opening into a large plateau and canyon. \r\nAlternatively, for a less risky off-piste experience, all ski levels can enjoy the snowcross zones which offer all the thrills of unpisted slopes in a safe, patrolled setting: the black snowcross zones of Crozats and La Frontaliere; red snowcross zones of Les Brouchaux and Pschott; and the blue La Combe des Marmottes snowcross &ndash; a playful area of small undulations, ideal for families.\r\nOn the pistes\r\nExpert/Advanced: Expert skiers should make their first port of call the infamous Swiss Wall. Early risers will often find powder conditions, making it not nearly as terrifying, but leave it too late in the day and the Wall turns into a seriously steep icy mogul field. Take the lifts up to the Chavanette sector and beyond the Swiss border lies the Wall. Before entering the Wall, you pass the \"For Experts Only\" sign. After you've completed the first six turns and rounded an overhang, the Wall reveals itself as a steep 200-metre slope. Do not try to attempt the wall in icy conditions &ndash; it can be fatal.\r\nWhen your legs have stopped wobbling from conquering the Wall, take the Grandes Combes lift up to 2,400m to reach the long, steep black runs down to Les Prodains &ndash; the most demanding in Avoriaz, and featuring an Olympic downhill.\r\nAdvanced skiers have a huge concentration of long reds, winding through the trees, between Les Lindarets and Chatel.\r\nIntermediates: Gain confidence on the three long, gentle blue runs from the top of the Grandes Combes. Other options include taking the Chavanette and Fornet lifts to cruise some seriously long blues or exploring the pretty, tree-lined routes leading down to Les Lindarets and Chatel. There&rsquo;s plenty of gentle intermediate terrain above Champery in the Planachaux area. From here you can also reach the large open skiing around Champoussin and Les Crosets.\r\nBeginners: Enrol in the Avoriaz Alpine Ski School staffed with British instructors while children aged from 3 years spend a full day&rsquo;s skiing (with lunch and tea) at the Village des Enfants. After a confidence-building ski lesson in the morning, head out onto the sunny green and blue slopes right next to town to practice your turns. The blue snowcross, La Combe des Marmottes, is an unpisted, but patrolled zone offering a playful area of small undulations, ideal for families.\r\nPark/Pipe\r\nThe half-pipe has been transformed into a Super-Pipe, now 120-metres-long and six metres high.\r\nThe well-maintained Arare Snowpark, which can be accessed from Grandes Combes, is billed as &ldquo;the real snowpark for freestylers&rdquo; and is for advanced to expert skiers only. It features kicker and rail lines as well as an airbag jump. Next to the Arare Snowpark is the boardercross: &lsquo;blue&rsquo; to warm up and &lsquo;red&rsquo; to really challenge your skills.\r\nLa Chapelle snowpark is ideal for beginners and intermediates with its jumps of all sizes. It has been designed to meet the needs of both skiers and snowboarders and features different obstacles (boardercross, jumps and woops).\r\nIntermediates can also hit The Stash, with its wooden and natural elements. Kids have their own mini snowparks at Parkway and Lil&rsquo;Stash.",

        "name": "Chamonix",
        "description": "Chamonix is the place to go for alpine thrill seekers wanting to push themselves to the extreme. The resort is known the world over for its steep, challenging runs, off-piste powder, and dramatic mountain scenery. Its legendary 20-kilometre (12-mile) Valley Blanche is a high off-piste run, the longest in Europe, and a rite of passage for ballsy skiers on their way to becoming experts. Chamonix hosted the first ever Winter Olympics in 1924 and is considered by many to be the birthplace of alpine skiing. The resort is a large, yet attractive town offering both traditional charm and a lively nightlife.\r\nChamonix ski resort is located a little over an hour form Geneva, one and half hours from Chambery, two hours from Turin and a little over two hours from Lyon. All these locations are serviced by major airlines. From these hubs, you can rent a car or take an airport transfer. Trains also move in between most of these locations.\r\nThe Mountain Chamonix's ski area (1,035-3,842m) is spread across five mountains: Grands Montets, L'Aiguille du Midi, Le Br&eacute;vent and La Fl&eacute;g&egrave;re (lift linked) and Le Tour, so skiers must be prepared to travel if they want to ski multiple areas. The good news is that recent lift upgrades mean shorter queuing times.Chamonix is one of the giants for freeriding. The Aiguille du Midi and Grands Montets cable cars offer access to the off-piste powder on the glaciers. Freeriders will encounter some mind-blowing scenery along the way - deep crevasses, ice falls, clifftops, and caves.From the Aiguille du Midi (3,812m) you can see the French, Swiss and Italian Alps (including Mont Blanc on a clear day). This is the view just before skiing down the 20-kilometre Valley Blanche - a totally unmarked and unmaintained off-piste run.Freestylers describe Chamonix as one big playground with an abundance of natural freestyle terrain. There are also two snowparks and a half-pipe.Beginners and intermediates aren't left out in the cold; there are plenty of long green, blue, and red runs with reliable snowcover on which to practise turns.Chamonix makes up part of the Mont Blanc ski area. There are two ski passes to choose from: Chamonix Pass (&euro;237/week) or the Mont Blanc Pass (&euro;289/week).Powder DayChamonix's popularity means its runs tend to get tracked out by lunchtime, so advanced skiers should head to the high off-piste terrain to avoid the crowds (take the Aiguille du Midi or Grands Montets cable cars). There are many dangers not least from crevasses, seracs, cliffs and avalanches so it's worth getting a handful of friends together and hiring a guide for the day; a guide will not only ensure safety but will show you some of the mountain's hidden gems. The one thing all powder enthusiasts seek is the run that keeps going for miles and Chamonix has plenty of those. The 20-kilometre (12-mile) Valley Blanche is the obvious place to head to. Accessed by the Aiguille du Midi cable car (3812m), The VB has a 2800-metre vertical and some very real dangers; only skiers able to parallel turn on a red run should attempt it (a guide is strongly recommended). There are several variants of the run: the Normal Valley, the Petit Envers du Plan and the Grand Envers du Plan; the latter two are more visually interesting, but are more heavily crevassed and hold a higher risk of avalanches. The VB is best skiied in Feburary/March time (don't leave it too late in the day for safety reasons).Besides the Valley Blanche, check out the powder on the Lavencher bowl accessed by the Bochard lift. The extreme freeride race, Red Bull Snowthrill, is hosted here each February.Heli-skiing is another option; many companies offer heli-drops on the Mont-Blanc massif just over the border in Switzerland or Italy (heli-drops are illegal on French National parkland). Evolution 2 runs heliskiing trips to the Val Veny in Italy, 20 minutes from the centre of Chamonix, costing &euro;350 per person (see above for contact details).Beginners/IntermediatesFirst-timers/Children: Chamonix has four nursery areas: Les Planards, Les Chosalets, Le Savoy, and La Vormaine, all of which are covered by the Chamonix Pass. Ski kindergartens operate in Le Savoy (1049m) and La Vormaine (1480m). The Chamonix Ski School, 190 Place de l'Eglise (+33(0)450 532 257) take children from three years. The Paradis des Praz children's ski park (+33(0)661 732 300), located behind the golf course in Les Praz, is open Wednesdays, weekends, and school holidays and is popular for its snow rafting; &euro;2,50 for 20 minutes.Beginners: The only complaint about Chamonix's beginner ski areas is that they're a little fragmented from the rest, but there is a good choice. Les Chosalets (1,230m) is 500 metres from the Lognan/Grands Montets cable car in Argentiere and ideal for beginners of all ages. Les Planards (1,062-1,242m) is a large ski area for both beginners and intermediates with four runs (one red, one blue, two green) and a mountain restaurant; snow cover here is guarenteed with 41 canons.Intermediates: There is a good choice of long blue and red runs to practise turns, particularly in La Flegere and Les Houches. The disadvantage of Les Houches is that it's not covered by the Chamonix Pass and it is also littered with drag lifts. The higher slopes of Les Grands Montets (2,765m) offer long, wide runs as well as steeper, more challening terrain to test your skills as your confidence improves later in the week.FreestylersChamonix has two snowparks: one in Les Grands Montets and the other in Les Houches. Les Grands Montets Snowpark is located at the mid-station of Lognan. Freestylers of all levels are welcome: the Fun Zone is ideal for beginners with its practise area of gentle jumps: the Snow Bowl attracts the more advanced for its table-top jumps, big kickers, and banked turns. Most years there's also a natural half-pipe.Les Houches' Area 43 is a mobile park unit - basically a container dropped into place by a helicopter (like the one in Kitzbuehel) featuring boxes, rails, and tables. Although smaller than Les Grands Montets Snowpark, more modules are expected to be added to the park over time.Freestylers don't have to limit themselves to the snowparks: Chamonix has an abundance of natural freestyle terrain, such as jumps, quarter-pipes, and gullies, particularly in Le Tour and La Flegere. The latter is also home to the popular Big Tit Jump, which is the largest natural kicker in Europe. ",

        "description": "Whether with family or with friends, whether you're sporting or not, Ancelle is waiting for you. Whether you're interested in food and wine or downhill skiing there is something for everyone. The downhill skiing on offer is well exposed to the weather and receives a good snow covering throughout the winter season. The varied cross-country skiing allows the less daring to explore the mountain range, skiing through the dabbled light of the larch forests of the Southern Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Ancelle ski resort, built at 1350 metres high, prides itself on its wonderful views, its array of activities on offer and of cause a good quality of snow that satisfies skiers and snowboarders of all abilities.\r\nThe entire area (excluding Costebelle-Moissière and the ‘Piste B') is covered by a comprehensive snowmaking system that ensures a sufficient snow cover throughout the winter.\r\nAt the bottom of the slopes, visitors can ski down to a choice of friendly sun soaked terraces. For kids and adults alike there is a popular area set aside for tobogganing right at the bottom of the ski lifts!\r\n\r\nFor those ‘Nu Skool' Skiers and snowboarders the resort and association of Ancelle Polemik have built a great snow park and a boarder cross track since 2006. The freestyle area is highly accessible, with a range of jumps, rails and features for all abilities. At the bottom of the ski slopes visitors will find the \"Polemik” Park. The Snow Park is made up of many different obstacles, a kid's area with music, a picnic table and a barbecue. A great place to hone your skills, to learn to “freestyle” or just enjoy the good humour that is always in the air!\r\n\r\nThanks to its unique location, nestled in middle of an open plateau exposed to a large amount of snow, Ancelle is also well suited to traditional Nordic activities. You can choose between 4 cross country ski loops for all abilities and fitness levels (from 3.5 to 10 km). There are also many other places to go walking. The ski resort links to 8 other ski villages and in total has about 200 km of trails that allow visitors to get around the mountain range relatively easily.\r\n\r\nAccommodation in Ancelle is well varied (hotels, lodges, charming bed and breakfasts, campsites, furnished apartments, etc...) and has all the traditional mountain resort facilities easily accessible.\r\n \r\nWith an ESF (French Ski School) and a Snow Kindergarten, Ancelle is able to accommodate all the family. After a busy day, what could be nicer than a stroll in the village for a warm crepe (French pancakes) or the discovery of Ancelle's unique high-alpine architecture.",

        "description": "The Meije Glacier cable car opens the doors to a ski area which is not actually a ski area. This magical skiing landmark is one of the world's last true holy grails in which skiers can be free and truly live by their passion. In La Grave there are endless routes down the series of small valleys, for the most daring, those of the Meije, and for those searching a little safety those of Chancel.\r\n\r\nBetween the 3600 metre high Dome Lauze (the top of the resort) and the 1500 metre base in the village, Romanche, there are no marked ski runs, everyone can choose their own line, where to make their mark. Each person can make their own unique pattern in the La Grave snow. Internationally renowned, the valleys of Meije gather, each year, passionate skiers and snowboarders from all over the world. This is Europe's mecca for freeride skiing.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the valley, there is a whole different atmosphere ... Two resort villages; Le Chazelet and Villar d'Arène both welcome skiers of all abilities. These towns offer skiing in a quiet, peaceful and idyllic setting, far from the overcrowded, purpose built ski resorts. The prices of the ski passes are competitive and the slopes are great for young novices, or just if you're out to have some fun.\r\n\r\nIn winter La Grave is also the meeting place for experienced ice climbers. The valley is transformed into an ice palace, counting nearly 130 waterfalls for all different ability levels. With their crampons and ice axes strapped-on, ice climbers, sometimes from afar, conquer the great walls of ice.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally La Grave is stunning; it is useless to search for the typical wooden chalets usually associated with the French Alps here. In this authentic town the small chalets that you can imagine are huddling together to keep warm, are all constructed from stone.\r\n\r\nFor food lovers, the local speciality at party season in Villar d'Arene and La Grave is a wonderful sort of cabbage tart/quiche. Other specialities in the ‘Pays de la Meije' include ravioli, rissoles (small pies), pognes and crozets (similar to meatballs).\r\n\r\nFinally, ultimately the most famous event that takes place in La Grave: The \"Derby de la Meije\", this legendary race pitches the best skiers and snowboarders against the mountain. Riders come from all over the world to participate. Solo, in a team or disguised: everything goes; the only mission is to get to the bottom first. On the day, there is only really one challenge; to do better than last year! The festive atmosphere that coincides with the event is fantastic; great food, street performances and live music.",

What with the snow park and a mix of ski slopes for all ability levels, visitors are guaranteed an enjoyable stay. Les Orres ski resort is constantly making efforts to better itself, the facilities in resort for sport (The Pousterle run hosts a round of the European downhill ski cup) and at the same time for families makes it a holiday destination certainly worth considering. \r\n\r\nIn Les Orres, visitors can enjoy a thousand and one activities before and after skiing, through either practicing other sports, or learning about the magnificent local area. On offer the town has, to name but a few Skijoring, fly jumping, paragliding and snowmobiling for all but the most adventurous; For those who are looking to relax, there is a sauna and massage centre. The must try in town is certainly \"The Orrian Express\", the local bobsleigh track, overlooking the valley, you won't have much time to take in the view on the 1.5km long track which drops 710 vertical metres, spiralling 3 times. The track is a one of a kind in the Hautes-Alpes.\r\n\r\nLes Orres resort is trying hard to meet the demanding expectations of parents on holiday with the kids. There are care facilities for all age groups: The Nursery welcomes children from 6 months to 5 years, the snow garden from 3 to 6 years and for older kids, the Juni'Orres kids club from 6 to 12 years old.

        "description": "Kandersteg is a picturesque, traditional village with a long, long history in the midst of stunning Alpine scenery.  It has maintained its relaxed and friendly character through centuries of hosting guests, first traders and for the past few centuries, tourists - for the last 100 years in winter as well as summer.   It's location with a short easy transfer from Swiss capital Berne is an added bonus.\n\nThe village grew up at the northern end of the trade route from Italy over the Simplon Pass, which was busy for millenia.  It was dangerous too and eventually the poor farmers of the area built the village church which still stands today from 1510 partly in order to give travellers a place to pray before and after making the Alpine crossing.  \nThe church bell was cast in 1541 and is still used to ring in the New Year.\n\nTourism began some two centuries ago after a visiting doctor wrote of his experiences of the beauty of the area and the healthiness and good nature of the inhabitants.  At that time in the late eighteenth century medical advice was actually against staying in the mountains and mountain air generally believed to be unhealthy.  The doctor's review, along with improved access and facilities led to a growth in tourists.\n\nIn the summer of 1860, two Englishmen, a vicar and a doctor and an American arrived in Kandersteg and asked for a guide to take them to the top of the Blümlisalp (3663 m above sea level). The young Fritz Ogi was the only person with enough courage to take the job. He became the founder of a mountain guide dynasty.\n\nThe latter half of the twentieth century were boom years for Kandersteg bringing true stability and some prosperity to the locals for the first time.  New hotels were built.   Mark Twain stayed in the village for the night of August 23rd, 1878 and then hiked over the Gemmi Pass. His humorous but accurate account of his journey can be found in his book A Tramp Abroad. The guest book at mountain guest house and restaurant Schwarenbach half-way across the Gemmi Pass has inscriptions from many famous personalities such as Alexander Dumas, Picasso and Lenin.\n\nWinter sports began more than a century ago, visitors initially attracted for the curling, but they have never really been the all encompassing attraction that they are at many other top ski centres.  Kandersteg has far more to offer than many ski centres and a much greater proportion of its clientele visits, year round, for the hiking, fishing, flora and fauna or just the stunning scenery than is the ski resort norm. \n",

        "description": "So which is the world's most famous ski resort? Opinions remain divided and a truly international poll of public opinion has not yet been carried out.  North American candidates would possibly be lead by Aspen with Vail and Stowe in contention or even the modern number one, Whistler.  In Europe there's St Anton, Kitzbühel, Chamonix, Val d'Isère and perhaps half a dozen more, but given a mix of the ski world and the general public, wouldn't St Moritz come out top?  \r\nWhether or not it is the best well known for the correct reasons is debatable, it's famous for being the playground of the rich and famous and for being a touch expensive, both of which remain largely true.  On the other hand it's not well known for having great skiing, which it does.  Some may also imagine it to be a quaint Alpine village, which it isn't, although the lakeside setting in the Engadin Valley is stunning.  It is also not generally reported that, although a genuine traditional settlement, St Moritz is a high altitude resort with an excellent snow record and glacier skiing.  Finally it should be mentioned that whilst many other famous names from skiing history have contented themselves to rest on their reputation, St Moritz and the Engadin Region have invested heavily in state of the art lifts and are now served by a host of high speed detachable quad and six seat chair lifts.  Oh and the sun shines 322 days a year, Switzerland's sunniest spot.  \r\nSt Moritz can claim to be the birth place of winter sports holidays.  In 1864 the owner of the Kulm hotel bet some English tourists a free stay if they dared to spend the winter there.  They took him up on this proposition and the rest  is history.  St Moritz was reported in The Times of London a few years later when a guest recorded with surprise the flowers in the hotel window boxes on Christmas Day.  By 1910 around 2000 guests spent the winter in the resort, most from Britain.  \r\nSkating remained the most popular winter sport until the 1920s, with skiing dismissed as a serious sport by the locals, but then came the 1928 Winter Olympics and a new mountain funicular railway, followed soon after by Switzerland's second ski lift.  The fifth Winter Olympics were staged in the resort once again in 1948.  Later the rich and famous who flocked to St Moritz helped to develop the possibilities of glacier skiing on the Diavolezza glacier and later heli-skiing. In fact the resort can claim a long list of 'firsts' from opening Switzerland's first tourist board in 1864 and switching on the country's first electric light in 1878 to staging the first ice skating, curling and winter sports championships in the 1880s and even Europe's first golf tournament in 1890. \r\nSt Moritz was the first resort to register its name and logo, in 1987. Finally, it must be noted that St Moritz's fame as a health resort does pre-date winter sports by several millennia. The first settlements are known to have existed here 3,000 years ago and the resort was also one of the world's earliest spa centres, well known as such by the time the Romans rolled in in 15 BC. ",

The extensive, varied slopes span 188km with scenic views from the upper runs. Further down you'll find pretty, wooded runs that stretch a long way and are ideal for bad-weather days. The resort has invested heavily in terrain parks and has some amazing facilities including the Olympic super-pipe and indoor freestyle facilities. Freeriders flock to the many 'freeride runs' which are essentially ungroomed pistes.\r\nBest suited to? Intermediates and freestylers\r\nBeginners can practise at the nursery areas at resort level and they'll find good, easy runs to progress to. Intermediates are spoilt for chocie with a great variety of slopes, particularly good is the area below La Siala and the sheltered Grauberg valley. There are also some suitable freeride runs for trying off-piste.\r\nAdvanced skiers do have some black runs but perhaps more appealing is the wealth of off-piste terrain and the challenging freeride runs (which vary a lot in diificulty).\r\nWhat&rsquo;s the resort like? The resort is divided into Laax, Flims and Falera. Generally speaking Laax is more modern and lively while Flims is quieter and more traditional. Some of the villages, including Flims Waldhaus, offer efficient ski buses.\r\nOff the slopes? Ice skating at the sports centre in Flims, make huge jumps at the Freestyle Academy, enjoy a game of ice hockey at Prau la Selva sports centre or take the kids to Laax Swimming Pool.\r\nDownside? The sunny slopes mean snow conditions can be a little hit and miss in the spring. Also choose your accommodation carefully, some are far from ski lifts.\r\nNearest airport(s): Zurich 143km\r\nVideo: Ludvig Billtoft freeriding through the woods in Laax and enjoying every second of it (8.1.19)\r\n",

        "description": "At the heart of the Jura region of France, the Haut-Jura nature reserve. Four villages which are dotted about in the reserve have come together and created a modern yet authentic ski area. The villages of Les Rousses, Prémanon, Lamoura and Bois d'Amont make up the area, which borders with Switzerland. The small resort which stretches from 1120 to 1680 metres in altitude is an ideal place to get away from the hustle and bustle of modern life and enjoy some unspoilt nature.\r\n\r\nThanks to its position on the French-Swiss border Les Rousses offers no less than 5 alpine ski areas:\r\n- The Franco-Swiss ski area (30 marked ski runs): Is made up of Dole Massif (Switzerland) and the Tuffes Massif (in France). There is a specially built linking ski run between the two resorts.\r\n- The Tuffes ski area (13 marked ski runs) above the town of Prémanon is well regarded and has three different access points (Jouvencelles, Balancier and Darbella). The resort has everything a modern ski resort should have and everything is in reach by ski. It is a truly delightful ski area for families.\r\n- The Serra ski area (13 marked ski runs) is above the town of Lamoura. The area has recently been improved and upgraded with a newly installed chairlift and new ski runs.\r\n- The Noirmont ski area (10 marked ski runs), the most popular in the Haut-Jura range, is above the town of Les Rousses and has the Franco-Swiss border at mid-height of the resort. The ski slopes are set to delight skiers out looking for hair raising adventure and speed. \r\n- The Bellefontaine ski area (3 marked ski runs): This area is ideal for families who are just beginning to learn to ski. The reduced size of the area compared with the others lends itself to safely being able to teach children how to ski. Reduced in scope compared to other areas of the resort, its slopes are ideal for skiing with the family.\r\n\r\nFor the younger generation Les Rousses ski resort has 3 bordercross courses: \r\n- A bordercross course accessible to all on the Serra blue slope\r\n- A bordercross course on the Entreroche blue slope (Bellefontaine ski area) \r\n- In the Tuffes Massive (Jouvencelles) there is a natural bordercross course (take the Jouvenceaux chairlift) \r\n(Worth a note as well that there are also two snow parks in Tuffes and in Serra. Equipped with various rails and boxes) \r\n\r\nLes Rousses is one of the largest ski areas in France, offering over 220 kilometres of regularly groomed ski runs.\r\nSpread across 6 different areas, the cross country skiing in Les Rousses varies in difficulty, setting enough of a challenge for experts but also areas for beginners to start out. \r\n\r\nThe gentle landscape of the Haut-Jura lends itself particularly well to snowshoeing. Les Rousses ski resort has:\r\n- 18 Km of groomed snowshoe trails (access fee)\r\n- 50 Km of marked snowshoe trails (free access)\r\n- 10,000 hectares of virgin snow for freely snowshoeing around\r\n\r\nLes Rousses has several different solutions for the care of your children:\r\n- The Crèche \"Les Petits Randonneurs (Small Hikers)\" in Prémanon (children 3 months to 4 years)\r\n- The Lamoura Recreation centre \"Les P'tits Boulis\" (for children 3 to 12 years)\r\n- The Les Rousses day-care (for children 3 months to 6 years)\r\n- The “Francas” recreation centre specialising in local woodcraft (for children 3 to 11 years)\r\n- The “Jacobeys” recreation centre (for ages 5 to 13 years).",

Many activities and tours are particularly suited to a child audience: luge, dog sledding, amusement park, kids circus, karting, creative writing, and an arcade...\r\n\r\nIf childcare is a concern, it needn’t be; La Bresse has a range of childcare options already in place:\r\n- The crèche \"Les P'tits Amis de Oui-Oui\" (for children from 10 weeks to 5 years old)\r\n- The ESF “Mini Piwi\" (for children from 3 years old)\r\n- The ESF \"Club-Piwi Piwi\" (from 4 years old)\r\n- \"Ludoneige\" (Snowfun) Club for 4 to 12 years old\r\n- The \"Opoual Pack\" for kids 6 to 11 years old\r\n\r\nAll the childcare clubs schedule fun-filled activities, exploring the mountains, learning to ski, tobogganing and snow ball fights top name but a few.\r\n\r\nAdults rest assured, you’re not forgotten either. Judge for yourself: snowshoeing, snow kiting, ice skating, a swimming pool complex, recreation centre, climbing, Fantasticable (Mega-Zipline), bungee jumping and paintball.

        "description": "Courchevel is a winter playground for the rich and famous &ndash; attracting a steady influx of stars from Beyonce to Beckham. Ironically, the resort was originally planned to create jobs and skiing for the masses, but somewhere along the lines it morphed into the luxury resort of The Alps.\r\nThere are 50 five-star hotels in the whole of France and nine of them are in Courchevel. As well as top hotels, the resort now boasts three Michelin-star restaurants. The multi-level resort, complete with heated pavements, is dotted with more than 100 boutiques - you&rsquo;ll find as many diamond dealers here as ski-hire shops. The tourist board does stress they offer a range of amenities for a wider clientele; it&rsquo;s not all Herm&egrave;s, Louis Vuitton and Valentino.\r\nThe resort consists of four ski villages: Courchevel 1300 (La Praz), Courchevel 1550, Courchevel 1650 and Courchevel 1850. While 1850 has the most high-end hotels and shops, its modern development is decidedly lacking in charm. Fans of the traditional French feel should head to Courchevel 1650.\r\nCourchevel is a good all-round resort. Its ski area offers a good selection of runs for all levels and it is also popular with families, off-pisters and non-skiers. The resort&rsquo;s 150 kilometres is enough for most, but the avid skier can buy a pass to the vast Three Valleys ski area, opening up 600 kilometres of lift-linked runs. Ski Pass for access to the vast lift-linked ski area in the world (600km).",

        "name": "Morzine",
        "description": "Morzine&nbsp;is one of 14 resorts in the massive&nbsp;Portes du Soleil ski area&nbsp;(650km) which straddles the Franco-Swiss border. With 52 hotels and 41 bars and restaurants, it&rsquo;s a concentration of ski holiday facilities, but still manages to pull off that authentic mountain village feel.\r\nWhen it comes to the slopes, Morzine is a fine destination for&nbsp;beginners&nbsp;and&nbsp;intermediate&nbsp;skiers, with an abundance of gentle pistes. It&rsquo;s also a good place from which to explore the Porte du Soleil&rsquo;s many off piste options if you&rsquo;re feeling adventurous. Lifts often lead directly up to these areas, which mean less hiking and more skiing. Freestylers, however, may want to skip Morzine and head to neighbouring Avoriaz, since Morzine&rsquo;s park doesn&rsquo;t offer anything exceptional.\r\nMorzine is sandwiched between&nbsp;Les Gets&nbsp;and&nbsp;Avoriaz. If you don't think you'll cover all 278 pistes of the Portes du Soleil Pass, you can opt for a Morzine-Les Gets Pass, which is good for 64 runs or an Avoriaz pass for 49 pistes. Many of the Morzine-Les Gets pistes run through forested areas, making for a pleasant backdrop to a quiet ski day. As for Avoriaz, the pistes are higher up, so the snow quality is better longer.If you're intermediate and up, a Portes du Soleil Pass will be worth the money. It opens the way to 106 blue runs, 100 red runs, and 20 challenging black runs, including the&nbsp;Hauts Forts&nbsp;at Avoriaz and the&nbsp;Swiss Wall&nbsp;at Les Crosets.Powder dayMorzine offers a good starting base for off-piste skiing, since the&nbsp;Nyon&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chamossi&egrave;re&nbsp;lifts run to the top of the mountain and can get you away from the groomed areas without having to climb on foot. Nyon has a good choice of itineraries between the groomers, so you can choose depending on how adventurous you feel. Just be careful not to go through the trees leading to the&nbsp;Vall&eacute;e de la Manche&nbsp;- on the other side is a drop off.An alternative choice is the&nbsp;Pointe d'Angolon, on the left of the Chamossi&egrave;re lift. The arrival point offers a fantastic view of the Mont Blanc before skiing on the ridge to the&nbsp;Col d'Angolon.&nbsp;In terms of challenging pistes, Morzine offers nine black runs and 29 red runs, some of which could actually be considered black if they didn't run right into the village. Pistes A, F, and R are pretty steep for red runs, but at the same time wide enough for making large turns.The red&nbsp;Aigle Rouge&nbsp;is a sharp switchback slope but for an exciting variation, you can short cut the switchbacks by taking a steep off-piste drop that runs back to the piste afterwards. You can also choose to take the&nbsp;AIgle Noi, a bumpy black, or the red&nbsp;Combe, both of which run down to the Pointe lift.Family skiingWith five green and 23 blue runs, Morzine is an ideal destination for beginners and lower-level intermediate skiers. Since easy slopes tend to be near the base village, natural snow conditions can be variable, but the resort makes up for this with a thorough network of snow guns.On the Pleney side, you'll find a special beginner area, with wide tree-lined slopes where you can learn to ski in a pretty setting. This also runs into some gentle and easy enough blue runs that can be done after a few tries on the greens.However, this area gets very crowded during the school holiday times, sometimes, with up to a 10 minute wait for some of the magic carpets.&nbsp; As soon as you progress beyond an absolute beginner level, it's a good idea to try the blue runs, which tend to disperse the crowds a bit better.Piste B,&nbsp;C, and&nbsp;D&nbsp;are all good options, none of which are steep or tricky.&nbsp;Piste B&nbsp;is the longest and thus, the gentlest while Piste C has just enough slope to challenging advancing beginners.Another option is the&nbsp;Proclou&nbsp;area, on the Super Morzine side of the resort. It is the largest and widest zone where you can learn to ski and is the base camp for the Avoriaz Ski School. But like the&nbsp;Pleney&nbsp;area, it gets crowded during peak weeks, so come here to build your confidence, then fan out to the less crowded runs.Park/PipeMorzine is Avoriaz's next door neighbour, and as such is pretty light on park and pipe opportunities. If you are looking for some serious park time, you really should head over to Avoriaz, where you'll find different parks, including&nbsp;The Stash, which was designed by Burton and all features ecological modules.Avoriaz groups its park and pipe areas collectively into the&nbsp;Avoriaz Snowzone, made up of five parks, a really big superpipe (120 metres long and six metres high), and two boardercrosses. All in all, these are some of the best and most varied area for freestylers of all levels and even kids, thanks to the&nbsp;Lil'Stash park.The&nbsp;Chappelle&nbsp;park is good for practicing jumps, since they come in threes, meaning more jump for your queue time. It also has progressively difficult beginner to intermediate modules, you can ride at your level.The&nbsp;Arare&nbsp;snowpark is for more advanced freestylers, with big modules and skiers rotating, flipping, and spinning in every direction. You'll want to build up speed to clear the modules, so this one is not for the faint of heart or lower intermediate levels. But they can always watch the spectacle put on by the other skiers and boarders.Morzine itself does offer a 200-metre-long&nbsp;boardercross&nbsp;in the Nyonet area as well as a park accessible via the Nyon lift. Here, you'll find a few easy jumps and a rail or two, but nothing spectacular. It's good if you just want to test the park experience, but if you're looking for something special, head to Avoriaz.\r\nApr&egrave;s/NightlifeTibetan Caf&eacute;&nbsp;recently changed names from the Buddha Caf&eacute;, but the Asian-inspired atmosphere remains the same-lively and hip. Giant plasma screens show ski, board, and biking action, while fresh-off-the-piste guests lounge on comfy couches and nosh on tapas. The bar is open from 4 p.m to 2 a.m, but starts jumping around 9 p.m. You'll find the Tibetan Caf&eacute; between the tourist office and the Pleney.Robinson Bar is an interesting apr&egrave;s-ski choice for three reasons&nbsp;: no music, a single beer on tap, and an 8 p.m closing time. Not convinced? The only beer served &nbsp;is the locally-brewed Mutzig, of an unknown, but presumably powerful proof. Instead of thumping tunes, the owners prefer to let guests recount the day's slopeside exploits. And the bar closes early because otherwise, the Mutzig would do you in. Sounds intriguing, no? You'll find it at the end of the village, near the church and the mayor's office.\r\nAirports\r\nYou can fly into one of several different airports and get to Morzine from there. Geneva Airport (90 km) is the closest and has many transfer options. Chambery (132 km), Lyon (208 km), and Grenoble (212 km), offer alternate fly-in destinations.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Skiing, winter sports and the friendly, familial atmosphere characterise the easy going and practical ski resort of Les Menuires.\r\n\r\nWith eight small villages each connected by ski runs, walking paths, chair lifts and shuttle buses, Les Menuires is now four decades old and mixes classical third generation ski resort architecture with the more recent classical style alpine chalets and luxury residences.\r\n\r\nLes Menuires is also (and foremost) situated right at the heart of the 3 Valleys ski area, a privileged spot in the largest ski area in the world offering visitors a great diversity skiing (600 km of marked ski runs linked by 180 lifts with direct access to Val Thorens, Meribel, Courchevel, Brides Les Bains and La Tania ski resorts).\r\n\r\nFor beginners there are five different free chair lifts for starting out, each in different areas of the resort. \r\n\r\nIntermediate skiers can take advantage of ‘Mont de la Chambre' at 2850 metres above sea level. A mix of blue and red runs sweep down the mountain side, ideal for perfecting those parallel turns! For the more experienced head over to the ‘La Masse' area of the resort. Here, there are several long and technical descents and 3 black slopes which are usually not that busy. The north facing slope often has great snow! \r\n\r\nFor the ‘Nu-Skool' freestylers the ‘La Becca' snow cross course is the place to be! There you can find a snow-park which features the all the essential elements; boxes, hand rails, big airs, tables, hips and quarter pipes. There are also three different bordercross courses to enjoy alone or with friends!\r\n\r\nIn addition to skiing, you can opt for a wander round the mountains, a bit of snowshoeing, snowmobiling, tobogganing or a visit to the swimming pool and fitness club. For culture lovers, the Belleville Valley has a hidden history waiting to be discovered. In town there are also often classical music concerts organised in the evenings.\r\n\r\nWhilst the adults are out enjoying themselves, the kids don't get left out: children will be pampered in the \"Piou Piou (Piwi's) Village\" that welcomes young'uns at an early age (3 months in the “Piou Piou Club” in La Croisette and from 31 months to 5 years old in the two “Piou-Piou” villages.",

        "description": "Meribel (1450m) is located slap-bang in the centre of the largest lift-linked ski area in Europe - the&nbsp;Three Valleys (600km). The majority of Meribel's local slopes&nbsp;(150km)&nbsp;are above the treeline, but there are also sheltered runs for bad-weather days.&nbsp;Meribel's well-groomed runs are served by a fast, modern lift system (mostly chairs and gondolas).\r\nBest suited to?&nbsp;The resort has enough varied terrain to keep all abilities happy: good, steep freeriding, plenty of long cruising reds and blues, as well as gentle tree-lined runs for beginners. Advanced and expert skiers who want to stretch their legs can invest in a Three Valleys Pass and hop over to&nbsp;Courchevel&nbsp;or&nbsp;Val Thorens&nbsp;to cover some serious ground.\r\nFreeriders -&nbsp;Mont du Vallon&nbsp;- the highest point in the Meribel Valley - has some of the steepest and best freeriding which manages to stay relatively untracked.&nbsp;\r\nFamilies/beginners&nbsp;will find a small nursery slope at&nbsp;Rond-Point used by the ski school.&nbsp;Mottaret&nbsp;also has three enclosed beginner areas covered magic carpet and the free village gondola. In the Altiport area, a family fun park (Acticross) has been created. The tree-lined green run at&nbsp;Altiport&nbsp;is ideal for beginners. Then head over to the green and blue runs at&nbsp;Mont du Vallon.\r\nIntermediates&nbsp;- Tougnete&nbsp;or&nbsp;Mont de la Challe&nbsp;offer quiet red and blue runs leading back down to Meribel in the morning sun. The&nbsp;Platti&egrave;res-Vallon&nbsp;sector has long reds and blues. For afternoon sun, take the gondola from Meribel to&nbsp;Saulire, for a good choice of long red runs.\r\nAdvanced/Experts&nbsp;- In the Meribel valley, head to&nbsp;Mont du Vallon&nbsp;for its long, steep red&nbsp;Combe Vallon&nbsp;run. From&nbsp;Tougn&egrave;te, there's a good selection of steep runs back to Meribel. Mogul fans should head over to&nbsp;Mont de la Challe&nbsp;for the mogul run down the side of the double Roc de Tougne draglift.\r\nFreestylers -&nbsp;A&nbsp;DC Area 43&nbsp;snowpark was set up in Meribel-Mottaret. This 1,200-metre-long snowpark is equipped with 24 snow canons and served by two lifts. Here you'll find one mini-skate ramp, three street lines, 220 metres of rails and an airbag for beginners. The&nbsp;Moon Park, Meribel Alpina's snowpark, offers lines for beginners, intermediates and experts.\r\nWhat's the resort like?&nbsp;This purpose-built ski resort is a firm British favourite. Meribel's clientele are around 50% British.&nbsp; Accommodation is largely made up of attractive, wood-clad chalets, as no high-rise architecture is allowed.&nbsp;Eating and drinking out in the resort can be expensive, but hit the bars at happy hour (4-7pm) and stock up on food in out-of-town supermarkets.\r\nAdvanced and expert skiers should consider staying in the village of Mottaret, just up from Meribel, which is better placed for access to&nbsp;the huge off-piste bowl in&nbsp;Mont Vallon, the DC Area 43 snowpark, and lift access to Val Thorens.\r\nNon-skiing activities: The Meribel Olympic Sports Centre has a swimming pool, ten-pin bowling, ice skating and a climbing wall. There's also a cinema and a twice-weekly market in the square sells cheese and meats.\r\nDownside?&nbsp;Snow on the west-facing side of the mountain suffers in the afternoon sun and the resort runs can get very crowded during peak season.&nbsp;\r\nNearest airport(s): Chambery (1.5 hours), Geneva (2hrs)",

        "description": "Ballsy, young boarders launch themselves at Les 2 Alpes&rsquo; challenging off-piste, world-class snowpark and energetic party scene. That said, Les 2 Alpes has plenty to offer all: The high and varied slopes are largely north-facing, so hold the snow well, and afford excellent views. There is also a snow-sure glacier for all abilities.\r\nBeginners will find wide, gentle nursery slopes beside the village and a good choice of ski schools while intermediates enjoy fast cruising on high red runs. More advanced skiers will eat up the powder-filled off-piste. The lively, modern town is stretched along a 2km strip lined with bars, shops, and accommodation for all budgets. A free shuttle bus links all parts of this large resort every 15mins. A six-day ski pass includes access to unpisted La Grave, Alpe d&rsquo;Huez, and Serre chevalier.\r\nThe Mountain\r\nFor a big resort, the ski area is smaller than you might think (134km). But the variable terrain does offer something for all levels and its high, largely north-facing slopes, hold the snow well. There is also the snow-sure&nbsp;Glacier du Mont de Lans, served by an underground funicular and drags, with its long, easy runs and awesome views.\r\nBeginners: Beginners have plenty of space to get started on the wide, gentle nursery slopes next to the village and seven of the nursery lifts are free of charge. Above the nursery area is the ridge&nbsp;of Les Cretes&nbsp;which also has gentle runs along it. It&rsquo;s also worth venturing up to the&nbsp;Glacier du Mont de Lans, served by an underground funicular, with its long, easy runs and great views.\r\nIntermediates: Head high for the best snowsure cruising terrain. For long runs on which to practise turns, the glacier is the place to go and has some pretty awesome views. From the top of the glacier, take the world&rsquo;s biggest on-piste vertical descent (2,270m) down to&nbsp;Mont-de-Lans. There&rsquo;s also some good, fast cruising between the glacier and&nbsp;Toura.\r\nAdvanced/experts: Some of the best, steepest blacks in Les 2 Alpes include the run down the&nbsp;Bellecombes chair&nbsp;and the shorter black served by the&nbsp;Super Diable chair. Another option is to take a snowcat tow over to the challenging, unpisted slopes of&nbsp;La Grave&nbsp;(covered by a six-day Les 2 Alpes pass). Off-piste is the main attraction for confident skiers.\r\nOff-piste:&nbsp;There&rsquo;s some great off-piste to choose from in Les 2 Alpes. Some of the best include Grand Couloir Chutes, Clot de Chalance, La Dome Glacier, and La Grave. The&nbsp;Grand Couloir Chutes&nbsp;is made up of three short, steep chutes that are accessible from the Bellecombes chair. The&nbsp;Clot de Chalance&nbsp;is more of an open bowl where you can take any route down to Les Gours piste and is accessed via the Signal lift (Chalance is prone to avalanches). &nbsp;La Dome Glacier&nbsp;from 3400m is a long, off-piste run with a 400m vertical which takes you down to the Signal chair.&nbsp;La Grave&nbsp;is a thrilling, unpisted and untamed ski area (accessed on the Les 2 Alpes ski pass) which is great for advanced skiers or powder fans but not suitable for beginners.\r\nSnowparks:&nbsp;Les 2 Alpes&rsquo; snowpark &lsquo;Freestyle Land&rsquo; is located in the Toura area at 2,600m. The well-maintained park has a kids&rsquo; mini park, a beginner area, and a slope-style line with rails, hips, boxes, tables, a big air jump.

        "name": "Les Arcs",
        "description": "Les Arcs&nbsp;is best for intermediates, experts, freestylers\r\nHighlights:&nbsp;Car-free villages, beautiful views of Mont Blanc, snowsure slopes, varied skiing with lots of long descents, wooded runs, plenty of challenging steeps, a huge amount of off-piste and a leading terrain park with snowboarder-friendly draglift.&nbsp;\r\nNon-skiers: Leisure pool at&nbsp;Mille 8, spa facilities at&nbsp;Sources de Marie, bowling, skating and cinemas with English films.\r\nNearest airports: Chambery (127km/2hrs), Geneva (156km/3hrs), Lyon (200km/3hrs)\r\nNearest station: Les Arcs is very easy to access by rail from the UK as it's located just above Bourg-St-Maurice, which is a direct stop on the Eurostar service.\r\nSix-day ski pass: &euro;265\r\nThere are three original resort bases, which have been given different names over the years but approximately equate to their altitudes &ndash; 1600 (the quieter, family-oriented one), 1800 (the main resort for all) and 2000 (the sporty one).\r\nAll share one of the world&rsquo;s biggest ski areas with hundreds of pistes opening up one of the world&rsquo;s biggest lift-served verticals at more than 2000m and served by an efficient network of high speed lifts &ndash; there&rsquo;s something for all ability levels.\r\nSki area: 200km local slopes (425km Paradiski area)\r\nThe slopes and lift network of Les Arcs are among the most extensive in the world.&nbsp;More than 100 pistes for all ability levels add up to&nbsp;200km&nbsp;of marked trails, served by more than&nbsp;60 lifts. The skiable&nbsp;vertical of 2,026m&nbsp;is world class and the terrain available is more than doubled if you purchase the Paradiski pass (425km) which then includes the runs of neighbouring and lift-connected La Plagne.\r\nAll of the skiing is well integrated with a high-speed lift network &ndash; there are no walks or bus rides required to make connections &ndash; and you can reach a very snowsure height of&nbsp;3,226m. But you don&rsquo;t need to head that high for great snow; most slopes north facing with extensive snowmaking systems so snow cover is rarely a problem.\r\nUnsurprisingly, given the scale of opportunities available, Les Arcs offers something for everyone: wide, gentle green pistes; steep, high-altitude glacier runs well above the treeline; sheltered descents through the forest; as well as a vast amount of off-piste terrain in between all these groomed slopes.\r\nThe longest groomed trail is 7km in length and the 19 black runs adding up to some 43km of piste in that category alone is one of the highest percentage of steep terrain in the Alps &ndash; but still leaves nearly 160km of fast cruising terrain suited to beginners and intermediates.\r\nFreeriders\r\nLes Arcs has a great reputation for off-piste terrain; the resort covers a huge area and much of it is outside the groomed motorways.&nbsp;The north face of the&nbsp;Aiguille Rouge&nbsp;is highly regarded with its long ridge opening up a myriad of off-piste options in what&nbsp;are the few remaining areas of the Tarentaise not yet filled with lifts and pistes.\r\nIconic trails include the steep&nbsp;Couloir en S&nbsp;which pitches at up to 45 degrees and the 7km, 2,000m-vertical descent from the top of the Aiguille Rouge down to Villaroger.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s also a popular excursion to take the Vanoise Express over to La Plagne and then ski down through the&nbsp;Nancroix forest.&nbsp;\r\nGiven the scale of terrain available, if you&rsquo;re not totally familiar with the dangers of off-piste skiing it&rsquo;s essential to employ a guide but there&rsquo;s also the Avalanche Parc up at Col de la Chal where you can research avalanche information and practice using search and rescue equipment free of charge.\r\nIf you prefer to stay on the piste but experience&nbsp;ungroomed terrain, you can choose one of the 10 runs which are made safe and signposted by ski patrol but are left ungroomed: Varet, Cr&ecirc;tes, Dou de l&rsquo;Homme, Lanches, Robert Blanc, G&eacute;n&eacute;pi, Bois de l&rsquo;Ours, les Bosses, les 2 T&ecirc;tes and Malgovert pistes.\r\nLes Arcs also has a speed riding school up at Arc 2000, the largest in France, where you can hit the powder with a small paragliding sail on your back to get some really big air on your descent.&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t need to be a pro skier to do it, just confident on your skis.&nbsp;Taster sessions are &euro;85 with a full week&rsquo;s course &euro;475.\r\nFamilies/Beginners\r\nLes Arcs is a very family-oriented resort, on and off the slopes, with 75-percent of terrain rated easy or intermediate and more than&nbsp;50 blue runs&nbsp;to choose from.\r\nIn general terms the terrain becomes progressively more challenging the further you ascend with gentle runs through the woods down at Arc 1600, then the heart of the ski area is home to many wide cruising blue and red pistes as you move above the treeline, and then the upper runs on the exposed Aiguille Rouge offer some of the greatest challenges.&nbsp;A&nbsp;sign as you board the cable car up here advises that only good skiers should attempt to ski down.&nbsp;There are red as well as black options.\r\nThe resort has a long-standing reputation for excellence in ski tuition dating right back to the 1970s when it pioneered &lsquo;ski evolutif&rsquo; which saw first-timers learn proper technique (rather than progressing from snowplough) on progressively longer skis.&nbsp;This teaching method was superseded by the arrival of carving skis, but Les Arcs has sought to maintain its leading status as a teaching resort and operates a number of&nbsp;learner-only areas&nbsp;close to the resort bases, complete with easy to ride conveyor lifts serving very gentle gradients. The most recent opening is at Arc 2000 close to where the Olympic Flame is located commemorating the resort&rsquo;s role in the 1992 Albertville Olympics.&nbsp;Both adult and child beginners are welcome to use these facilities.\r\nOnce all are capable of basic turns, families will all enjoy a run down the&nbsp;Milka piste&nbsp;at Arc 1800 which is complete with information panels on local fauna and flora and cut ot shapes of the same on the off chance you don&rsquo;t spot the real thing out on the snow.\r\nThe once you&rsquo;re more confident still you can test just how fast you&rsquo;re sliding on the automated speed test course up at Arc 2000.&nbsp;The start of the course is accessed from the Plagnettes chair lift and at the bottom an electronic sign will tell you how fast you&rsquo;ve skied.&nbsp;Les Arcs is keen to stress that the point of this is to warn of the dangers of excess speed on the piste, not to encourage speeding!\r\nPark/Pipe:\r\nLes Arcs plays a very important part in the history of freestyle. Always a pioneer of &lsquo;nouveau&rsquo; snow sport, something very similar to a snowboard was seen on the slopes here some years before Jake Burton created &lsquo;the first&rsquo; snowboard, and many other sliding devices too, most notably the monoski, which were popular here when unknown elsewhere.&nbsp;Ski movies of the modern variety were also first shot in Les Arcs, including the pioneering&nbsp;Apocalypse Snow&nbsp;films.\r\nThe main terrain park here takes its name from those famous films. The huge&nbsp;Apocalypse Park&nbsp;in the heart of the ski area just above Arc 1600 has a vast array of terrain features and lines for all ability levels over tables, hips, a funbox, pyramid and jumps of various sizes.\r\nThere are other attractions dotted around the huge area too, including a great boardercross course up at Arc 2000 where the Piste du Plan Vert is divided into two rolling boardercross routes for different confidence levels.\r\nThere&rsquo;s also a second smaller park, the&nbsp;Rey Park, with two lines suitable for novices or advanced riders, as well as a second boarder cross course at the opposite end of the slopes at Peisey Nancroix, with access from the top of the Peisey chair lift.\r\nWith a Paradiski pass you can also head across the Vanoise Express lift for over snow access to La Plagne where more world class terrain parks await just minutes away.",

The second, larger ski area is on&nbsp;Mont D'Arbois&nbsp;which is connected to Rochebrune by a &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; cable car (but without a piste connection) or can be reached direct from the resort, although the base of the Princess gondola is 3km from the resort and reached by ski bus.&nbsp;You can ski down from Mont D'Arbois to neighbouring resorts&nbsp;St Gervais&nbsp;and&nbsp;St Nicolas de Veroce&nbsp;over the far side of the ski area.\r\nThe third area,&nbsp;Le Jaillet, is located on the other side of town and was previously not connected to the other two areas, but from 2012-13 the resort has introduced a horse-drawn caleche (a kind of long sleigh for which Megeve is famous) to take skiers from the ice rink in the centre of town to Jaillet instead of having to take the bus.\r\nA criticism often made about Megeve in the era of high-altitude French ski centres is that the slopes (1,100-2,353m) are low by modern standards, however locals claim this often works in their favour, as runs are open here when high-altitude lifts in the neighbouring Chamonix Valley are closed.&nbsp;The highest skiing is at&nbsp;Cote 2000&nbsp;(Rochebrune sector) and&nbsp;Mont Joly&nbsp;(Mont d&rsquo;Arbois sector).&nbsp;\r\nMegeve is particularly popular with the Parisienne crowd, and the slopes are very quiet mid-week except in the main French holiday periods.&nbsp;It also does not fit the mass market tourism sector so you are unlikely to find big crowds of Brits either.\r\nFreeriders\r\nBecause Megeve is not known as an off-piste resort one can usually find some good off-piste several days after a snowfall.&nbsp;But even so, the obvious places will get skied out quite quickly and as with powder days anywhere in the world, it&rsquo;s important to be first on the slopes when the snow falls in abundance, and the quickest way to reach the best spots is usually to get the first bus in the morning.&nbsp;\r\nThe main areas for enjoying fresh powder are from the two highest points of the ski area at&nbsp;Mont Joly&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cote 2000. There are many bowls and runs through the trees opening out into fields and glades but you need to ski with someone who knows the area.\r\nBeneath Mont Joly the whole mountain below the ski lift is left unpisted and offers some of its steepest and challenging terrain around Megeve.\r\nIt&rsquo;s also possible to ski over the back from the top of the Mont Joly lift and off the map but this is avalanche territory so it&nbsp; is potentially a matter of (your) life-or-death that you seek help from a professional guide if you wish to attempt&nbsp; that.\r\nThere are long term plans to link Mont Joly to Les Contamines which will open up a lot of off-piste.\r\nCote 2000 has a large off-piste area with the best terrain off to the right&nbsp;of the ski lift but you have to cross the ladies downhill piste and this is often cordoned off for race training.&nbsp;\r\nJaillet/Giettaz&nbsp;also has some great off-piste and once again a guide is the best idea to take you to it and also ensure you coordinate your descent with bus services which you will need to connect to at the bottom, as the best runs don&rsquo;t connect back to the lifts.\r\nIf you wish to make more of your location than the nearby slopes, mountain guides office (+33 (0)45 50 21 55 11;&nbsp;guides-megeve.com) will be happy to take you on guided half-day or full-day tours to nearby areas including Chamonix (where the&nbsp;Vallee Blanche&nbsp;is an option), the grand massif, the Aravis and Courmayeur.&nbsp;They even offer heli-skiing into Switzerland and as far as the Atlas Mountains in North Africa.\r\nFamily/Beginners\r\nA major difference between Meg&egrave;ve&rsquo;s ski area and that of most other well-known French ski areas is that much of the terrain is below the&nbsp;treeline, resulting in hundreds of kilometres of easy-to-moderate cruising on trails cut through the forest.&nbsp;Of course, with the ski area being so large, there&rsquo;s open terrain above treeline too, especially on Mont Joly and at Cote 2000, home to most of the resort&rsquo;s steeper red and black pistes, but overall it&rsquo;s very family-friendly fayre.\r\nRuns are up to 3.8km long and popular descents include the red down from L&rsquo;Epaule to St Nicolas de Veroce which offers particularly splendid views of Mont Blanc and the fast Princesse gondola accesses some great terrain directly above the resort.\r\nAlthough the local skiing is within the three separate sectors, each area is large enough to provide at least a day&rsquo;s entertainment, and the lift/sleigh links between them mean you can travel from one to another quite quickly if you wish to. If you purchase the Evasion Mont Blanc pass you can also take the ski bus to neighbouring ski areas including Les Contamines.\r\nMost of the beginner slopes are down by the village in the classic style so as long as snow cover is good they&rsquo;re very convenient.&nbsp;A low-price beginner&rsquo;s lift pass is available and there are free easy-to-ride magic carpet lifts for beginners&rsquo; use at&nbsp;Rochebriune,&nbsp;Princesse&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jaillet.\r\nChildren aged 3-5 have several&nbsp;snow gardens&nbsp;operated by Club Piou-Piou, a division of the local French Ski School (+33 (0)4 50 21 00 97;&nbsp;megeve-ski.com) and located by the Chamois gondola (accessed from the village centre) and at the bottom of the Mont d&rsquo;Arbois cable car.&nbsp;Each is equipped with fun runs and magic carpet lifts and the Club offers full or part day care (reservations essential).\r\nPark/Pipe\r\nMegeve&rsquo;s old school image and reputation for generally mellow terrain mean that it is not at the forefront of most people&rsquo;s minds when asked to recommend a freestyle Mecca, so it may come as a surprise that the resort is home to three terrain parks at the last count, with several more separate terrain features at&nbsp;other locations too.\r\nThe four are located in separate sectors and are not, perhaps, world class, but each has its charm and a good selection of hits.&nbsp;Most have snowmaking so terrain features can be created if Mother Nature doesn&rsquo;t play ball.\r\nClosest to the village is the&nbsp;Waidzai Park&nbsp;on Rochebrun accessed by the Grand Champs chairlift.&nbsp;This is best suited to the less adventurous with small-to-medium jumps, whoops and a pyramid as well as&nbsp;a big air bag and a 500m snowcross course.\r\nThe park is equipped with three automatic video cameras; you can download footage of yourself in the park at the end of the day by keying in your ski pass number and if you wish put it up on Facebook.\r\nA second park at the foot of the Mont Joux lift on&nbsp;Mont D'Arbois&nbsp;has some more challenging jumps with a good selection of rails to ride and another cross course.\r\nOther parks and features are on&nbsp;Jaillet&nbsp;where there&rsquo;s snowcross track and at&nbsp;Giettaz&nbsp;(links to Jaillet) which has what some consider the best snowpark of the four with a wide range of jumps and rails as well as another snowcross course.\r\nAirports\r\nThere are three airports within two hours' drive of Megeve along with two small local airfields close to the resort but only served by domestic French airlines or for private flights.\r\nGeneva International Airport&nbsp;(87km/1hr),&nbsp;Chambery Airport&nbsp;(95km/1.5hrs)&nbsp;&nbsp;Grenoble Airport&nbsp;(160km/2hrs)&nbsp;Annecy airport&nbsp;(41km/30 minutes)&nbsp;Aerocime Meg&egrave;ve&nbsp;(1km/5 minutes)",

        "name": "Vars",
        "description": "At 1850 metres altitude in the heart of the Hautes Alpes, the Vars ski resort has become one of the most desirable resorts in the Southern Alps. The resort is right on the edge of some of the biggest mountain chains in the French Alps and is nestled amidst splendid larch forests which are tremendously well preserved. The surrounding mountains (Massif des Ecrins, the Queyras and Ubaye) are stunning and the ski runs top out at close to 3000 m in altitude.\r\n\r\nMade up of 4 small hamlets which span the length of the Route des Grandes Alpes, Vars has successfully combined authenticity and charm of a traditional village mountain village with the comfort of a large winter sports resort. Its natural history and good climate make Vars a very desirable place to spend your holiday.\r\n\r\nVars - La Forêt Blanche (The White Forest) is the union between the Vars and the Risoul ski areas. The ski area is vast offering 185 km of marked ski runs. There is a huge diversity to the skiing; the ski area is a huge recreation area enabling skiers and snowboarders to learn what great skiing really is. With its network of artificial snow covering all the main ski slopes, La Forêt Blanche (The White Forest), ensures quality snow from mid-December to late April.\r\n\r\nThere are also 2 very famous snow parks in Vars:\r\n- The freestyle area, at 2400 metres in altitude, spans 8 acres right at the heart of the ski area.\r\n- The Jib Zone welcomes all amateur lovers of the new urban style skiing, right at the bottom of the slopes.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's worth a note that Vars was the destination for many of the world's most famous speed skiing records (the legendary Chabrières slope is the home of numerous speed records and other KL World Cups).\r\n\r\nFor freeriders, the Eyssina and Chabrières mountain chains overlook the ski area and have a veritable choice of skiable couloirs. There are nearly a hundred available, 20 of them directly accessible from the lifts.\r\nThe \"Y\", the \"Entonnoir (Funnel)\", the “Virgule (comma)\", \"Petit Col\", or \"Le Caché” and “La Banane\" boast descents between 30 and 50% accessible in  less than an hour walk from the lifts. Here you will find dreamy powder and some amazing skiing.\r\n\r\nFor those looking for a little bit of culture, you won't be disappointed. The local history in Vars is very interesting; discover the local cultural and sporting traditions. Vars offers a range of activities that will satisfy the most demanding of non-skiers: snowshoeing, winter walks, health centre (Nordic bath, Zen workshop, massages, spa, steam room, sauna, shiatsu, gym, etc.), Ice climbing, helicopter rides, ice skating and a cinema...",

        "description": "Family friendly, budget friendly and with a decent range of mixed ability terrain,&nbsp;Montgen&egrave;vre&nbsp;forms part of the extensive&nbsp;Milky Way&nbsp;circuit.&nbsp;\r\nIt&rsquo;s the only French resort out of six resorts that are linked together via the ViaLattea circuit and is connected to the villages of Sestriere, Sansicario and Sauze D&rsquo;Oulx in Italy.&nbsp; A cheap day extension gives piste-hungry skiers access to 400km of slopes in the Milky Way.\r\nThe village sits at an altitude of over&nbsp;1800m,&nbsp;on a minor pass, and is perfectly positioned to get snow from all directions &ndash; it therefore benefits from excellent snow cover. Snow-canons also now cover 55 per cent of the mountain, including most lower slopes.\r\nThere is skiing on both sides of the mountain. On the north-facing Les Gondrans you&rsquo;ll find nursery slopes, with a dedicated beginner&rsquo;s area, and the south-facing slopes of&nbsp;Le Chalvet are just behind the village. From Les Gondrans, you can access the on-piste link to Claviere and the rest of the Milky Way. Le Chalvet is a small mountain which the locals flock to. &nbsp;\r\nThe village itself is&nbsp;traditional yet modern, convenient and compact and accommodation is centrally located.&nbsp; There are a variety of lodging options available, from quite sweet boutique hotels to more fashionable hotels and upmarket self-catered apartments.&nbsp; Many of these new lodgings have direct ski-in-ski-out access making them brilliant bases for families with tired little skiers.&nbsp; Several bars, restaurants and shops line the village&rsquo;s main road and ski equipment hire shops are very good too.\r\nAlpine forests surround the village making it look particularly attractive when covered in snow and the locals are very friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-skiing&nbsp;activities include sleigh rides, snowmobiling, and snow-shoeing. &nbsp;But for those in search of something more thrilling, heliskiing&nbsp;in the neighbouring resort of Sauze D'Oulx can also be arranged.\r\nApres ski&nbsp;is quiet and the evenings offer a relaxed and calm atmosphere, ideally suited to those looking for a laid back atmosphere.\r\nMontgen&egrave;vre has a total of 59 slopes, covering 100km of pistes and served by 38 lifts. Of the pistes, 25 are beginner runs, 23 are intermediate runs and 11 are advanced runs. The ski resort has several runs of decent length, the longest being 7km.\r\nBeginners\r\nPiste-wise the resort is perfect for beginners who are in their element with a wide selection of easy green runs from the top of Les Gondrans all the way back down to the village. There&rsquo;s a wonderful nursery slope at the foot of Les Gondrans complete with magic carpet. Crowds are not an issue making Montgen&egrave;vre an excellent resort to learn in.&nbsp; Once beginners have practised their turns they should head to sunny Le Chalvet which has the long gentle Phare blue run.\r\nIntermediates\r\nIntermediate skiers can take advantage of nicely varied&nbsp;blues and reds above and below the tree line and even more cruisers in the vast Milky Way area.&nbsp;The overclassified blacks (in the Chalvet sector) are perfect for confident intermediates, and there are some nice reds &ndash; such as the narrow wooded runs to Claviere from Pian del Sole, and from Colletto Verde back towards Montgen&egrave;vre. Popular descents include the runs down from Les Anges and Le Querelay.\r\nThe&nbsp;terrain is diverse with&nbsp;open bowls and long groomed runs and intermediate skiers can confidently explore the whole resort. Shy intermediates have some excellent long runs on which to build confidence on both the Gondrans and Chalvet areas.\r\nTo access some fast reds and wide blues, hop aboard the Chalmettes cable car lift. &nbsp;From there, take the green La Crete to the Col Des&nbsp;Gondrans ski area.&nbsp;They all lead back to the foot of the two main lifts; Les Gondrans and Observatoire.\r\nExperts\r\nMontgen&egrave;vre is better geared towards advanced skiers and snowboarders who enjoy freeriding more than downhill skiing, as the marked terrain isn't the steepest. That being said, there are some decent red runs to carve and cruise.For exciting off-piste descents and bumps, head to the virtually untouched powder in the Col de l'Alpet area. Rocher de l'Aigle offers the most challenging descent and backcountry guides from&nbsp;nearby La Grave and Serre Chevalier regularly bring their clients here.",

        "description": "Serre Chevalier&nbsp;has a smorgasboard of goodies to offer its visitors. From a laid back style and friendly locals to excellent food and cheaper prices than those of its northernly neighbours,&nbsp;and, an abundance of quality and diverse terrain &ndash; all in all it&rsquo;s really quite something.\r\nSerre Chavalier is an attractive resort, with narrow cobbled streets and pretty shops lining the village&rsquo;s main road. Most of the accommodation consists of small chalets, family run B&amp;B&rsquo;s, or is self-catered.\r\nOne of the best things about the resort is its suitability to all levels of skiing ability. And there&rsquo;s heaps of terrain - tight, open trees, couloirs visible from the lifts, limitless banks and gullies, natural hits everywhere and a huge natural funpark.\r\nThe ski area is not a single resort, rather, it is made up of a dozen villages including Brian&ccedil;on, Chantemerle, Mon&ecirc;tier les Bains and Villeneuve which are connected by a bus service. The area comprises&nbsp;250km&nbsp;of well-linked pistes along the Serre Chevalier Valley between Brian&ccedil;on and Le Mon&ecirc;tier-les-Bains and forms part of the&nbsp;Grande Galaxie&nbsp;ski area (530km).\r\nThe resort&rsquo;s&nbsp;altitude ranges from&nbsp;1200m to 2800m&nbsp;so you can enjoy great skiing in a high mountain atmosphere. The runs, in and above a large&nbsp;larch forest, are on the north side of the high long ridge. There are bowls, valley descents and high off-peak faces.&nbsp; Serre Chevalier has phenomenal tree skiing too and is famed for its off-piste.\r\nSnow cover is exceptionally good which is down to the resort&rsquo;s&nbsp;north facing&nbsp;position. Slopes are colder for longer and they tend to hold onto more of the white stuff. The majority of the skiing is on the top half of the mountain and the trees protect the lower slopes. Snow making machines protect the base of the valley pistes and the grooming is consistently well done.\r\nSnowboarders&nbsp;love it here too and there is a dedicated freestyle zone, located in the ski area next to Villeneuve, which is divided according to level of expertise. There&rsquo;s also a boardercross zone in Chantemerle with banked turns and modules which are perfect for slalom addicts.&nbsp;\r\nBeginners&nbsp;have easy trails next to all of the villages and separate beginner slopes up the mountain. These are generally crowd free which gives newbies ample space in which to practice. We like the green runs around the Frejus charlift. On the downside there are a number of drag lifts to contend with.\r\nIntermediates&nbsp;have access to long cruising trails of up to 10km in length. At the Bachas chairlift above 1500 there are lots of pistes criss-crossing down through the larch forest . Recommended runs include the Cucumelle, Le Petit Alpe, Grand Gargouille and Bois des Coqs.\r\nOnce you&rsquo;ve weaved through the trees you can head to La Grave in just 30 minutes, and Montgenevre isn&rsquo;t far from Brian&ccedil;on. The lift pass includes Montgen&egrave;vre on the Italian border, and if you purchase an add-on pass, it&rsquo;s possible to ski, if conditions are right, all the way over to Sestri&egrave;re and Sauze d'Oulx in Italy.\r\nAdvanced skiers&nbsp;and riders, particularly those who love freesking, have masses of terrain to sample including the extensive backcountry and cross-country for which a number of guiding services are available. There are five cross-country routes in the valley of varying length and difficulty. Those who like marked runs will enjoy blasting down the Olympic Luc Alphand run &ndash; it&rsquo;s one of the fastest on the mountain. Expert skiers can also test their mettle on hairier challenges such as Jacksons or the T&ecirc;te de Grand Pr&eacute; and Montagnolle descents.\r\nFor fresh tracks make your way to the fields and trees off the Cibouit chair lift in Mon&ecirc;tier &ndash; take skier&rsquo;s right across the black run and use the shoulder above the Tabuc black run.",

        "description": "Pra Loup is one of the major ski areas in the Southern Alps with a friendly, laid back reputation and excellent lift systems. Lively, sunny, purpose built centre with two bases - the larger Pra Loup 1600 and the smaller Molanes at 1500m. Strong emphasis on family facilities and an excellent lift system linked to La Foux d'Allos in 'La Libert&eacute; de l'Espace'. The Pra Loup gondola is ideal for boarders and beginners as it goes straight up from the village at 1600 to sunny nursery slopes with nearby restaurant and stunning views. The easy green clappe run down from the gondola is fitted with permanent snow cannons ensuring snow cover at early and late season. Intermediates can easily get around the area on the numerous blue and red runs. Developing skiers will particularly enjoy this resort with its long open runs and lack of queues which makes it so much easier to ski non-stop and put miles under the skis. The off-piste is easily accessible and because the area is so huge compared to the tourist capacity theres often untracked powder which stays light and dry much longer on the north-facing slopes. Freeriders will love Pra Loup too - plenty of wide open fast runs with the occasional tricky stretch to hold your attention. Reputed to have some of the best snowmaking facilities in France, most of the runs back to the village have snow cannons which are used early season to provide a good base and then late season to keep access open. Purpose-built in 1961 the resort was named after the previous inhabitants of this spectacular site - the mountain wolves. Pra Loup is made up of 2 villages, Molanes at 1500m (Pra Loup 1500) and Pra Loup 1600m - the larger of the two - with most of its shops, caf&eacute;'s and bars within easy reach of the slopes.",

It is the rendezvous for all the nu-skool freestylers. The friendly area with its “cool zone” is the place to chill out for all of the younger generation skiers and snowboarders.\r\nIf you are a cross-country skiing enthusiast you can head over the specially constructed Nordic ski track on the Collet du Tât (1613m): 35 km of cross country ski tracks, surrounded by a wide variety of landscapes of meadows, forests and mountainous plateaus crossing from west to east.\r\n\r\nIt's worth jotting down that Dévoluy is without a doubt one of the best spots in the Southern Alps for ski touring. Surrounded by beautiful valleys which run in parallel next to one another, intertwined by a succession of peaks, plateaus and flats, the area lends itself perfectly to ski adventure.\r\n\r\nThe snow gardens welcome children from 3 to 5 years old. Ski lifts, tow lifts, inflatable toys plus much more await the little ones. Supervised by instructors from the French Ski School (ESF), children can have fun whilst experiencing skiing for the first time. At the child care Dévoluy, children from 15 months (from 12 months Super Dévoluy except holidays) to 6 years old are welcome. They can enjoy indoor activities, games and if there is good weather, outdoor activities as well.\r\n\r\nAfter a good day on the slopes visitors can choose between a range of activities and occupations some examples: gourmet meals, relaxing in the hammam or snowmobile riding at dusk. To visit Dévoluy is to taste what real mountain holidays are all about, be pampered, relax and enjoy sometime amongst family and friends. \r\n\r\nEach of the villages; Dévoluy, SuperDévoluy and Pra Loup all have different characters but all offer a wide range of accommodation solutions to satisfy everyone.",

        "description": "At the gates of Queyras and the Guil valley, sat on the edge of a mountain overlooking Mont Pelvoux and the Massif des Ecrins, the ski resort of Risoul. The resort is surrounded by a tremendous larch forest, which makes up “La Foret Blanche (The White Forest)” ski area.\r\n\r\nRisoul is situated at 1850 m altitude, the chalets and buildings are built from wood and stone, giving the appearance that the mountain village has been there forever. The hotels, holiday resorts and rental apartments collectively have some 18 600 beds. The main street and the ski slopes are at the heart of this bustling resort always alive, well and smiling. \r\n\r\nBetween 900 and 1300 m in altitude, the 17 hamlets of Risoul offer a selection of charming little hotels and traditional chalet based bed and breakfast accommodation. The historic villages have a rich rural and cultural heritage. Risoul is stuck halfway between authentic town and modern ski resort, the UNESCO world heritage site of Mont Dauphin (The fortified walled city of Mont-Dauphin) is only ten minutes away. Risoul is a quiet and comfortable place to spend a slightly different ski holiday without sacrificing the quality of the skiing. \r\n\r\nRisoul and Vars, the sister resorts found in the south east of France, share a network of larch forests which in turn are surrounded by an array of stunning mountain peaks. This perfect partnership is a union that satisfies hungry skiers eager for wide, fast ski runs and who are ready to do battle with the mountain. La Foret Blanche ski area finds itself nestled in the heart of the Guillestrois; this is a real mountain ski area which can be called home for all snow lovers who enjoy making the most out of this resort's outstanding potential!  (185 km of marked ski runs!) \r\n\r\nAs a leader within the French snow parks, Risoul is consistently at the forefront of this relatively new discipline in snow sport. Each year Risoul invests in the maintenance and development of their extensive park area: a fun zone, jumps, big air, gaps and rails are all linked together in the former 'Surfland' area which now hosts one of the largest and longest half pipes in France. \r\n\r\nIf you are a beginner wanting to learn to ski and have a great time there is a special area set aside for you. Family friendly and safe, the small beginners green slope is free. Access is by a little drag ski lift. It is the perfect place to find your ski legs!! \r\n\r\nThere are also two specially set aside areas reserved for tobogganing. They are free to use and one is even lit throughout the evenings. \r\n\r\nRisoul is a family resort therefore for a few years the team has been working on developing its child services, improving the infrastructure whilst enhancing family services, beginning with childcare. \r\n\r\nFor toddlers the resort has a range of activities in place allowing kids to develop their skiing whilst learning and enjoying the fantasy world of winter in the mountains. The specially designed kids areas cater for children from 3 years and up (heated cabins, hot drinks, ski lift, tow rope, magic carpet, figurines, kids ski cross, etc). \r\n\r\nYou needn't worry for the après-ski in Risoul, once the ski lifts have closed there are plenty more activities on offer to keep you and the children entertained: snowshoeing, paragliding, snow biking, snowmobiling, a natural ice rink, a cinema, gym, relaxation and wellness centre, Segways, quad-biking and paintballing to name but a few. In Risoul there is sure to be something for everyone.",

Cervinia is located on the Italian side of the iconic Matterhorn Mountain and skiing over to neighbouring Zermatt on the Swiss side is also possible, offering a combined 322km of slopes, linked with fast, modern lifts.\r\nBest suited to? Beginners and intermediates are spoilt for choice with endless long blue and red runs. Cervinia is also popular with freestyle fans who flock to the Indian terrain park (1.2km long, 200m wide and 11 features).\r\nWhat's the resort like? The small, car-free village has a pretty centre with charaterful cobbled streets and stylish Italian boutiques. It is popular with famillies and there's a good choice of ski-in/ski-out accommodation thanks to the reliable snowfall. Nighlife in Cervinia isn't too raucous, but livens up considerably at weekends with live music, djs and cocktails.\r\nThe views from the Italian side of the border are phenomenal which is not at all surprising considering that the resort is set in a jagged high-altitude basin in the middle of the Matterhorn and Piccolo Cervino (Klein Matterhorn).\r\nNon-skiing activities: Not many non-skiing activities, but plenty of sunny terraces on which to take in the dramatic scenery and enjoy afternoon drinks.\r\nDownside? There's not a huge amount for more advanced skiers/snowboarders to get their teeth into. High winds and low cloud can sometimes hamper conditions.\r\nNearest airport: Turn (121km/90 minutes)",

        "description": "The giant Monterosa ski area is one of the world's largest, and thanks to recent investment in new lifts you can now ski or board without needing to stop for 180km between the resorts of Champoluc and Gressoney and Gressoney on to Alagna across three valleys.  The skiing extends almost up to 3000 metres and there are spectacular views across Aosta Valley and Piemonte.  \n\nThe ski area was 'reborn' for the 2003/4 season when the spectacular Funifor cable car finally completed the long planned link in the circuit between the Valsesia and Gressoney La Trinite resorts (themselves connected to Champoluc).\n\nThe most internationally famous resort on the circuit, Alagna, is known for its old world charm and having been preserved from cement with its Walser buildings dominant.  It was founded in the 12th century and is built around the local parish church.  Although there's skiing for all standards, Alagna remains a haven for expert skiers, the village sits beneath one of the world's greatest lift-served verticals skiable by many off-piste descents.\n\nAt the other extreme of the pass, Champoluc at 1570m is the main resort in the Val d'Ayas.  Surrounded by pine woods, it offers spectacular views of the Monte Rosa glaciers and the rocky buttresses of Mont Sarezza and the Testa Grigia.\n\nAntagnod above at 1710m also has spectacular views as well as well preserved old buildings, including the famous maison Fournier once the stronghold of the counts of Challant.  \n\nBetween them Gressoney La Trinite - which is linked to the Monte Rosa circuit and Gressoney St Jean beneath it, which isn't.  The architecture is again beautiful, with chalet style buildings and again spectacular views.\n",

The resort has a lot of snow, and there is also a powerful snowmaking system. In the last years this resort has built a lot of new lifts, and Pila is now the only ski resort in Aosta Valley to have a 6-seat chairlift.

Those who prefer excursions without skis can opt for trips on snowshoes, snow walking and snow bike. Entracque has cross-country and downhill ski runs which are always well prepared. The ski-lifts of the Viver offer downhill ski runs, equipped with a powerful lighting system and artificial snow on 70% of the district. Cross-country skiers can take advantage of the Gelas Cross-country Centre: over 30 km of tracks, split into five circuits with differing levels of difficulty. The Feit run is FISI approved and can host international competitions. The track is served by an artificial snow system.",

The district has about 30 km of runs for downhill skiing and snowboarding, served by four ski-lifts and a two-seater chair-lift, with an hourly capacity of 1200 people. Most of the tracks face north, but from the start of the Mussiglione ski runs, on the peak of Monte Berlino, on clearer days skiers can enjoy a splendid view of the Ligurian coast and Corsica. The snowboarding run is equipped with a token-operated fixed timer system which enables boarders to measure their speed in competitions with friends. Although we can state that only at Garessio 2000 “can you see the sea as you ski”, the resort represents an excellent starting point for downhill skiing on the Maritime Alps.",

The town also offers access to the Maneggio area, dedicated to beginners. The Riserva Bianca (White reserve) can satisfy downhill skiing enthusiasts thanks to its 80 km of runs covered almost entirely by artificial snow systems and served by 16 lift systems, with stat-of-the-art telecabins and chair-lifts. The tracks vary in length and difficulty, with some runs designed for beginners and others which have hosted, among other things, the training sessions of the Italian and French national teams. The width of the runs makes them ideal for use by snowboarders, while those boarders who prefer to practise their acrobatic moves can do so in the 3500 square metres of the snowpark at Limonetto, equipped with half pipe, kickers, box and rails. A play park on the snow, with entertainment for young children can be found at Quota 1400, while numerous restaurant-chalets scattered across the slopes offer an excellent opportunity to relax, maybe enjoying the valley’s specialities.\r\nLimone and Val Vermenagna also make the most of cross-country skiing, with two centres dedicated to this discipline, one at Panice Sottana and another at Vernante, which have approximately 9 and 10 km of tracks respectively. The valley also attracts large numbers of ski touring enthusiasts as it is able to offer numerous excursions of varying length and difficulty, on famous slopes and peaks: from Cima Fascia to Vallone San Giovanni with Cima Pepino, from which one can enjoy an enchanting view of the Piemonte plain, the Ligurian Sea and Corsica, from Rocca dell’Abisso to Monte Chiamossero and to Monte Creusa, descending into Val Grande di Vernante.\r\n\r\n",

        "description": "For skiers, freeriders and ski touring enthusiasts, the kilometres of snow-covered slopes that surmount the Macugnaga basin definitely represent a delightful opportunity to try and endless range of different descents and excursions. It is possible to reach the top either by taking advantage of the heliski service or using the cableway that links Alpe Bill to the Moro Pass that travels into Switzerland, situated at an altitude of 2796 m. This system is part of the Monte Moro ski district which – at an altitude of almost 3000 m – offers the chance to test your skills against the very technical and difficult tracks of the Roccette or to descend the 7.5 km of the Meccia to reach Alpe Bill, skiing through a difference in altitude of over 1000 m. Just as interesting are the descents of the second district of Macugnaga, the Burky-Belvedere, positioned inside the basin, between the town and the impressive massif of the Rosa. A two-branch chair-lift leads from the hamlet of Pecetto to the 1613 m of the Burky and then to the 1932 of the Belvedere. The ski runs that link these last two localities are classed as some of the most beautiful in Macugnaga and have been chosen in the past as training ground for the Italian women’s skiing team.\r\nCross-country skiing is practiced on two tracks which place over 15 km of runs at the disposal of enthusiasts. The Signal track offers an ideal itinerary for skiing in peace in an enchanting setting. It is situated in Pecetto and bypasses the last chalets of the hamlet before climbing towards Monte Rosa to the wooden cross raised up to protect Macugnaga. For those with a desire to cover a difference in altitude, the Frazioni track winds along the whole right bank of the River Anza. The track descends from Pecetto to the picturesque chalets of Isella before climbing back up the slope and entering the Quarazza Valley, amidst the best-preserved territories of Macugnaga. Considerable attention is also dedicated to snowboarding. The main area is the Pink Snowpark of Monte Moro, at an altitude of 2800 m, which stays open until May. It has two different lines of jumps for beginners and professionals, a snowboard house and a sound system that pipes music throughout the whole park. Smaller areas are set up every year both in Burky and at the Sports Centre in town.\r\n\r\n",

The best known town of the Val di Fassa, Canazei is known for it's houses painted like something right out of fairy tale and for its hopping night life.\r\n\r\nCanazei has much more to offer than just skiing. The Eghes Wellness Center, for example, is a spa which follows the bioclimate philosophy of ancient Roman Thermal Baths. And then there's the \"G.

Fassa Levoni which plays in the National Hockey League.\r\n\r\nIn Canazei there are also important international races, like the Sellaronda Skimarathon in the winter, which is a nighttime downhill ski race, and the Dolomites Skyrace in the summer, which is the qualifying event for the High Altitude Running World Championships.\r\n\r\nThrough the years Canazei has undergone an intense touristic development, but it has never forgotten its Ladin origins, which are still visible in the local architecture and traditions. Every year at the end of August in occasion of the \"Gran Festa da d’Istà\", all of the Ladin valleys come together to celebrate. Traditional costumes, shawls, hats, aprons, jackets and pants, all minutely embroidered with styles that vary from valley to valley, attest to the region's rich history. ",

Not least because a new snow-park has been added to the existing Fondo Grande park in Folgaria. The new area dedicated to snowboarding acrobatics is situated in Lavarone, or more precisely at Malga Rivetta, on the other side of the Forti ski carousel. \n\nThe Turismo Lavarone Lifts Association, in collaboration with the White Crows Snowboarding Club which provided technical know-how, has set up the park aimed at all ability levels.  \n\nIts many special features make this park both unique and innovative. Beginning with the challenging rails of several different types, from straight double pipes (two parallel rails) to single pipes, and the rainbow, the pyramid and the king, which present varying non linear shapes. \n\nParticularly interesting are the three fun boxes: square raised platforms that allow riders to jump up and down from all four sides. Naturally there are also small and medium sized springboards used for air acrobatics.\n\nAs in the rest of the Altipiani di Folgaria, Lavarone e Luserna ski area, at Malga Rivetta too those who wish to try their hand at acrobatic snowboarding can hire all the necessary equipment , also for a less challenging practise of this discipline on the traditional slopes. For beginners lessons are available with the skilled instructors of the Lavarone Ski School.",

        "description": "The resorts of Soldeu, El Tarter and Pas de la Casa have merged to create the largest ski area in the country: Grandvalira.\r\nGrandvalira is now one of the world's 30 biggest ski resorts with more than 200km of piste and the first resort outside the Alps to officially offer more than 200km of ski runs, moving it into the global big league. Its 66 lifts, which include 20 high-speed detachable quad and six-seater chairlifts, along with three gondolas, give a combined uplift of more than 100,000 skiers per hour &ndash; a combination of speed and capacity matched by less than a dozen resorts worldwide. It is also now one of the planet&rsquo;s biggest and most modern snow-makers with more than half of its terrain covered by 1,000 snow cannons.\r\nWhile you can still find low-priced apartments, the range of quality accommodation on offer is a rather new thing. The best of the slope-side hotels is the five-star Hermitage and nearby Sporthotel in central Soldeu.\r\nGrandvalira continues to retain a hardcore party reputation, particularly at the resort of Pas de la Casa. It has a compact centre with a dozen or so small-to-medium sized bars in each. Service by English or Antipodean bar staff is the order of the day, with prices equivalent to those 'back home' or better, so they're lively as soon as the lifts close.\r\nAndorra doesn&rsquo;t have its own airport. The biggest airport is Barcelona (210 Km) and the nearest is l&rsquo;Alguaire de Lleida (158 Km). Girona (250 Km) and Reus (210 Km) are two other options. From here you can get to Andorra by car or bus. From France, the main airports are Rivesaltes airport (170 Km) in Perpignan and Blagnac airport in Toulouse, (196 Km).",

Run as a non-profit ski area that’s evolved from a ski club with mostly volunteer workers, the Mt Cain community has a lot of pride when it comes to their ski hill. Many of the regulars want to keep Mt Cain Ski Area a secret and some of them have bumper stickers on their car with the slogan \"Cain Sucks, tell your friends\" It’s not surprising that they want to keep Mt Cain hush-hush. Mt Cain Alpine Pine has the ideal trio of factors for a powder hound destination: an abundance of snowfall; amazing tree skiing and backcountry; and barely anyone there to take your fresh lines.",

Indeed the resort is a collection of villages spread around the lake and the skiing is on separate mountains - Kobla and Vogel, at each end of the Lake.  Located in the Triglav National Park, Bohinj also has a glacier above although the ski lifts do not reach it. \n\nThe mountain scenery of the Julian Alps is spectacular and snow conditions are often the best in the country as moisture from the Adriatic hits these mountains first as it travels inland.\n\nThe largest village in the area is Bohinjska Bistrica which is at the base of the skiing at Kobla which extends for a vertical kilometre above the village.  Kobla is the only ski resort in Slovenia accessible by train. \n\nAt the other end of the Lake a cable car lifts skiers up to 1544m where most of the skiing begins, in a narrow range up to 1800m.  However there is a long red right back down to the Lake at 570m, snow permitting.\n\nKobla has slightly more marked piste than Vogel, the two areas together have about 60km of runs.\n",

It is a popular destination for families and is particularly appreciated by all skiers looking for outdoor activities, nature and sports.The plebiscite of the Port del Comte families for its wide paths traced through the forest of black pines (this is also one of the characteristics of the complex). From the wide area for beginners to the very busy black slopes, the ski area of Port des Comte is ideal for everyone, from beginner skiers to freeriders ...Divided into two distinct sectors (Hostal-Sucre-B&ograve;fia and Estivella Area), the ski area in general benefits from good snowfall resulting from negative temperatures combined with rainfall emanating from the Mediterranean influence. This natural snow also has the backing of a powerful network of snow culture that guarantees the quality of the snow and the return of the ski stations to the feet throughout the season.The area totals 50 kilometers of tracks divided into 7 green, 11 blue, 13 red and 6 black. It extends between the snow front (at 1700 meters altitude) and the summit of the Estivella sector (beyond 2300 m).Since the 2000s, a vast investment and renovation plan has literally transformed the Port del Comte resort. We emphasize, the replacement of the old ski lifts by more comfortable and fast chairlifts, the establishment of carpets for beginners, the installation of high pressure poles for the production of the snow culture, the improvement and the accesses of asphalting and parking, tracks of remodeling and grass, etc. These investments, year after year, contribute to the renovation and modernization of the complex and customer satisfaction.Port del Comte now offers all the facilities and services that one \"is entitled\" to expect from a ski resort: 3 ski schools, a snow park, snowshoe / dog trails, tents (rental and sale of ski equipment). skiing, snowboarding and accessories), restaurants, snow garden, medical center ...In addition to skiing, Port del Comte offers a wide range of activities, both for children and adults: you can take long snowshoe walks on the many itineraries while enjoying the breathtaking scenery. The adventure park is also a must-see with its acrobatic circuit through which you will have to overcome the various obstacles between the trees. Another alternative: the snowtubing that allows you to follow the descents perched on a large buoy that slides along a giant slide of snow.",

It is walking distance to comfortable lodgings, ski slopes, good food, well-prepared  cross country ski tracks and the childrens' favourite - Gullfinnstigen (the Gullfinn trail), a storytale track where they can look for Gulfinn's gold nuggets with the help of amusing signs and figures.\r\nThere's downhill skiing for the whole family here. The slopes are generally easy and wide which makes them ideal for both children and carving enthusiasts. In Edsåsdalen people have been cross country skiing for over a hundred years.",

The skiing takes place in two zones – either inside or outside the ski area. There is ski patrol in the area and the risk for an avalanche is reduced daily to very little. If you choose to ski outside the area, you are completely vulnerable to your own judgement and your own decisions. A large dose of humility and own taking your own responsibility are needed.\r\n\r\nDespite the problem and dangers, there are possibilities that make Nuolja great. The advantage of you designing your own 500 metres of descent from the beginning to the end in natural mountain terrain.",

And, although the resort&rsquo;s location and lower elevation means the base area can be patchy, the resort has invested in snowmaking equipment and added or modernized lifts to the upper limits at 7,000+ feet.\r\nThe nearest airport to the ski resort is San Carlos de Bariloche (BRC) in Argentina. It&rsquo;s about 30 minutes by car between the resort and the airport. The resort is 12 miles from the city of Bariloche. A bus service is available between the bus station at the ski resort, but you will need a smart card to ride the bus, which can be obtained from your hotel.

        "description": "Located at an ancient European crossroads by the Simplon Pass into Italy, the small and picturesque town of Brig  was on the route for Napoleon's road building to give his armies better communications around Europe.  It is equally well placed today to give skiers rapid access to the major ski centres of the Swiss Valais, including Zermatt and Saas Fee. \n\nBrig boasts many architectural treasures, dominated by the impressive Stockalper Castle, with its three gilded onion-domed towers and galleried court yard.  The palace dates from the heyday of the town back in the 17th century under Kaspar von Stockalper, the greatest Valaisian merchant. He established a flourishing salt and silk trade between Milan and Lyons, and even organized the first postal service.  Stockalper built his sumptuous palace in the town center. The three square towers form the corners of a great courtyard with three tiers of arcaded walkways. The palace was in the hands of the Stockalper family which had become impoverished, until 1948, when it was fully restored. In summer, every space is filled with flowerboxes.  \n\nThe heart of Brig today, as for centuries past, runs up the Bahnhofstrasse, until it widens into two squares at the intersection with Rhonesandstrasse, and then Furkastrasse. Each square is focused on a fountain, monument or church. Most of this area  is a car-free pedestrian zone lined with old buildings which have a certain Mediterranean flavor.  Lined with shops and restaurants it makes a very pleasant base when off the slopes.  As well as excellent skiing from Rosswald above the resort, reached by gondola, there are a dozen major ski centres within an hour's drive including Belalp, Riederalp, Bettmeralp, Bellwald, Fiesch and, a little further, Zermatt, Saas Fee, Saas Grund, Crans Montana and Leukerbad.\n",

Most of the resort's skiing is between 2500-3500m and the largely northfacing slopes help maintain reliable snowcover. Fast, modern lifts serve the ski area and there is very rarely any queuing.&nbsp;\r\nBeginners and intermediates have miles of long, quiet runs on which which to practise turns. Snowbaorders flock to the high-altitude terrain parks. Unfortunately there isn't much scope for off-piste skiing.\r\nSaas-Fee village, often compared to Zermatt, has a slower, quieter feel and is favoured by families. This car-free centre has pretty, narrow streets lined with traditional chalets, apres-ski bars and family-friendly restaurants. Electric buses and taxis can take you around.\r\nNon-skiing activities: Outdoor ice skating, sledging, a revolving restaurant on the glacier (3500m) and an indoor leisure centre with a wealth of activities including a swimming pool.\r\nDownside?&nbsp;While its northfacing runs make for some great snowcover, Saas-Fee isn't the place to go for sunny lunches on the mountain, it's largely shady ski area can be cold unless you're on the move.",

        "description": "Located at the heart of Belledonne mountain range in the Isère department of France, the ski resort of Les 7 Laux, can be broken down into three separate areas: \r\n-To the east, Le Pleynet (1450 m), a big mountain resort that overlooks the Breda valley surrounded by the chiseled peaks of the Belle Etoile and the Cabottes. \r\n-To the west, Prapoutel (1350 m), the urban hub of the 7 Laux ski area where you can find all of the urban amenities (cinema, disco ...), and finally Pipay (1550 m), the well preserved village in the middle of nature, overlooking the Grésivaudan Valley. \r\n\r\nJust a little warning, it takes about an hour to drive between Prapoutel and Pleynet (through Allevard). \r\n\r\nOn the skiing side of things the 7 Laux ski area is particular because it has almost entirely been renovated over the course of the last few years. Indeed, in 10 years, 90% of the 7 Laux ski lifts have been changed, updated and modernised and the ski runs remapped. \r\n\r\nFor the ‘Nu-Skool’ generation, the resort of 7 Laux is a must-stop thanks to its renowned snow park ‘HO5’ which is constantly changing in order to keep up with the changing fashions and progression of skiing and snowboarding. It is also easily accessible thanks to its dedicated lift. There are three different areas available for you to try your hand at: \r\n- Ice-racing: try your hand at racing your friends on a specially built race course similar to a boarder cross track. \r\n- The Wolves Run: The rail park, learn how to freestyle on the mix of artificial and natural rails. \r\n- The Pro Park: Huge features within the pro level snow park. It’s ever increasingly innovative and creative and it’s the choice training ground for many European pro riders, a guaranteed show! \r\n\r\nIf you wish to cross country ski in 7 Laux, there are three different areas on offer: \r\n- 8 Km of tracks in Pleynet (1950 m) which are accessible with the Pincerie chairlift. \r\n- 50 Km of classic cross country tracks and ice skating are on offer in the Nordic area in Barioz (access via the Col du Barioz). \r\n- 16 Km of tracks in Prapoutel (1350 to 1500 m): a small yet charming area which has a moderate to easy terrain, challenging those who are just starting out. \r\n\r\nOnce the 7 Laux ski lifts and the ski area are closed, there are many fun and interesting activities to occupy yourself with: snowshoeing or dog sledding, paragliding, micro light flights, ice skating and a wellness centre (swimming pool, spa, sauna, Jacuzzi, steam room, solarium, lounge bar, rituals and care wellness). \r\n\r\nFor those who like a late night there is a nightclub “The Gambade”, a cinema and a dozen bars and restaurants. \r\n\r\nFor child care, no worries, the resort of Les 7 Laux has it all planned out: \r\n- The daycare \"La Farandole\" (Prapoutel) \r\n- The daycare \"The Ribambelle\" (Pleynet) \r\nBoth cater for children from 18 months to 6 years old and are open 7 days a week throughout the winter.",

        "description": "Les Contamines-Montjoie is a traditional mountain village nestled right at the base of Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nThe Les Contamines ski resort has been developed in a way that it lunges almost 5km along the valley, interlinked by footpaths criss-crossing the village and allowing relatively easy access to each of the little hamlets. To reduce car travel, Contamines Montjoie set up a shuttle bus service to get around the village and to also get to the bottom of the ski lifts. If bus travel isn't for you, there are also horse drawn carriages which can take visitors to bottom of the slopes, stopping off for a snack on the way! \r\n\r\nThe ski resort of Les Contamines / Hauteluce enjoys an exceptional amount of sunny weather and natural snow on both sides of its two major valleys, the Val Montjoie and the Beaufortain. The ski slopes meander down through each of the valleys, wide ski runs, surrounded by ancient forests, high altitude cabins and mountain farms. To make sure that the season lasts, there are 175 snow canons in place, toping up the natural snow through the early and late season.\r\n\r\nThe Les Contamines ski area has 120 km of varied ski slopes for all abilities. In the upper part of the resort there are excellent panoramic views, accessible on skis, overlooking the biggest mountain in Western Europe, Mont Blanc. In the lower parts of this ski paradise, find yourself skiing amongst the forests, great on the rare cloudy days. Note that the Evasion Mont-Blanc ski pass that you can purchase in Les Contamines also allows access to Saint-Gervais, Megeve, St Nicolas de Véroce, Combloux and La Giettaz. Six ski resorts that total more than 445 km of marked ski runs.\r\n\r\nTo show that the resort is committed to the development of the new disciplines in skiing and snowboarding, Les Contimines has introduced their X-Zone. There are multiple zones set aside for the new freestyler generation, whether on skis or on a snowboard: \r\n- The ‘X-Zone des Loyers', situated in the heart of the village is an area set aside for the lovers of aerial acrobatics.

        "description": "Pretty, charming and unspoilt, the old farming village of Les Gets has something special to offer every visitor, with a variety of skiing to suit all levels, but where this magical resort truly excels is in the service that it provides to families.&nbsp; The resort is a proud owner of the 'Famille Plus Montagne'&nbsp;label, which means that the needs of younger guests have been carefully considered.&nbsp; Facilities include a medical service for minor injuries, and events, such as carpentry workshops where children are taught to make wooden models, are geared towards providing them with a safe and exciting stay.&nbsp;\r\nThe resort has top notch ski schools, several of which have won awards, and extremely good nursery slopes are located in the centre of the village.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also a great place for adult learners; try the British Alpine Ski and Snowboard School which offers group and private lessons.\r\nOne of the many draws of Les Gets is that it&rsquo;s reachable within an hour&rsquo;s transfer from Geneva. The other draws include conveniently laid out lifts, minimal queues and un-crowded slopes &ndash; which makes a change from most French resorts which tend to get very busy.&nbsp; The quiet slopes can become a little less quiet on the weekends due to the fact that the resort is within easy reach of Geneva and Lyon but it still won&rsquo;t be jam-packed.&nbsp; On the downside, at 1172m altitude, snow is not guaranteed at village level, however, there is much more skiing and fun to be had up the mountain at Chavannes including more nursery slopes.\r\nThe resort is located on the outer circuit of the Portes du Soleil ski network which, with 650km of pistes, is the largest linked ski area in the world.&nbsp; The Portes du Soleil connects 12 ski villages, each with its own distinct character, and Les Gets is one of the best bases from which to start exploring! Although, if you want to explore the whole area, then stay at one of the villages within the inner circuit of Portes du Soleil, as these are better connected.&nbsp; Lastly, but certainly not least, Les Gets has been making efforts to be environmentally friendly. &nbsp;Diesel generators on lifts have been replaced with solar panels,&nbsp;artificial snow is made without chemical additives and groomers are using bio-degradable diesel fuel &ndash; all things that make the OnTheSnow team very happy indeed.",

        "description": "With a rich ski heritage, pristine snow, a rustic Alpine village and acres of interconnected terrain to explore, Morillon is the favoured resort of those who want some quality skiing without the glitz and glamour. &nbsp;And as it&rsquo;s located just 15 minutes from the nearest motorway junction it&rsquo;s one of the most easily accessed resorts in the Alps.\r\nThe resort is nestled in the Giffre Valley in the Haute Savoie region of the Northern French Alps, only 55km from Geneva airport, and although Chamonix is close by the two resorts couldn&rsquo;t be more different in terms of, well, everything. &nbsp;Chamonix is home to expert terrain and is firmly on the party-map while Morillon offers the best gentle terrain for beginners. You wouldn&rsquo;t describe the former as cute or simple but the latter is both. &nbsp;Morillon is tiny and often overlooked, but, it&rsquo;s very sweet, its slopes are crowd free and as it&rsquo;s part of the Grand Massif ski region with access to 265km of downhill skiing and 351 individual pistes (served by 78 ski lifts) it makes for a really good base.\r\nThe resort is one of five linked resorts, each with their own unique character, that make up the Grand Massif ski area. There&rsquo;s Flaine, previously nicknamed Phelgm, which is known for its offensive concrete apartments, Morillon 1100 (also called Les Esserts) - the purpose-built village above Morillon. There&rsquo;s also Les Carroz, with its gorgeous tree-lined runs, and Sixt-Fer-a-Cheval, very authentic French and exceptionally pretty. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s worth exploring the Grand Massif region and an all- area ski pass will give you access to ski or snowboard in all of the Grand Massif ski resorts.\r\nAs for Morillon, it&rsquo;s pretty and sleepy, and families with young children may just love it. It would be difficult not to, what with an assortment of blues, the terrain is largely suited to beginner and intermediate level skiers, the resort is compact and the village centre is pedestrianised, it&rsquo;s quite charming and nursery slopes are centrally located. &nbsp;The ski schools are very child friendly and include ESF Morillon which provides skiing, snowboarding, ski-touring and mountaineering, snowshoeing and adaptive skiing classes. There is a children&rsquo;s village which looks after little ones as teeny as six-months old. Find it underneath the cable-car arrival station.\r\nSnowmaking operations have improved in recent years and there are now dozens of snow cannons on the ski run which connects Morillon village and Morillon 1100. This a particularly nice cruiser which is open for longer during the season.\r\nOne thing that&rsquo;s really great and of which other resorts should take note are Morillon&rsquo;s efforts to make skiing accessible to everyone. &nbsp;The Handi TATU Giffre Association was set up in the region with the specific aim of advancing access to ALL in Morillon and in the Grand Massif Area.&nbsp;&nbsp;The association works with Morillon ski school ESF for driving or teaching seat-ski.&nbsp; Something to note: &nbsp;since 2011 skiers with disabilities have been able to access Les Esserts directly by the cable car.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn terms of where to stay,&nbsp; we like the rather sweet Hotel Morillon which is ideally located just a stone&rsquo;s throw from the slopes. A former bakery, the hotel has all the features of a gorgeous rustic Alpine hotel with a touch of chic.&nbsp; The rooms are romantic - all pinewood and hearts &ndash; there&rsquo;s a huge fire where you can enjoy cozy evenings with your family, and a modern spa and pool for the ultimate in relaxtion.",

        "description": "The charming ski resort of Pralognan la Vanoise is found just at the entry to the Savoie department, France and is nestled right at the foot of one of the Alps greatest glacial ice caps. The resort is full of character and the locals welcoming and friendly.\r\n\r\nSituated at the end of the Tarentaise Valley, between the resorts of Courchevel and La Plagne, the family orientated resort has lots to offer throughout the winter as well as the summer.\r\n\r\nAs a relatively small scale ski resort, Pralognan la Vanoise has a ski area which lives up to its remarkable surroundings. With the magnificent setting right at the foot of the Grande Casse (The highest peak in the area) and in the middle of the Vanoise National Park, skiing here is about as close to nature as you can get. Expect to see local chamois and ibex playing in the snow. From Pralognan village at 1400m the ski area extends right up to 2350 metres above sea level. Because of its proximity to the Vanoise glaciers, the snow cover is generally very good. In addition, there are 70 snow guns topping up the natural snow, from 2350m right down to the village.\r\n\r\nProlognan ski area has skiing for all abilities; \r\n- For beginners: the Mont Bochor and in the village, two ski slopes set aside; Barioz and Poucet.\r\n- For Intermediates: tree skiing and mogul fields.\r\n- For Experts: a range of couloirs and powder skiing on the Combe des Pariettes.\r\n\r\nThere is also Nordic skiing in Pralognan. It is the 4th largest cross country ski area in the Savoie boasting 26 km of well-maintained ski tracks going in and out of the forest and across the Pralognan Plateau. The majority run alongside the winter footpaths accessible on snowshoes.\r\n\r\nIn total Pralognan has nine regularly maintained paths for snowshoeing and Nordic walking. The paths lead to ‘La Corniche', the ‘La Fraîche' waterfall or a lookout point. The paths facilitate access to the beautiful little hamlets and villages all around Pralognan. To access the mountain restaurants and bars without skis the Edelweiss and Genepi chairlifts as well as the Mont Bochor cable car are always open for pedestrians.\r\n\r\nFor those non-skiers, Pralognan la Vanoise has a selection of activities:\r\n- Ice skating, curling, pool, relaxation centre (sauna, steam room, Jacuzzi), bowling and an arcade all in the “Prélude Olympique” sports and recreation centre.\r\n- There is also the bobsleigh rack, organised torchlight visits around the village and the surrounding hamlets, conference facilities, historic tours and a cinema.\r\n\r\nPralognan la Vanoise is certainly one of safest resorts around for kids. As the village is right at the end of the valley, it doesn't have any main roads going through it, nor heavy traffic. As a small resort it's defiantly a favourite for families. The ski school (ESF) and the childcare centre are located right in the centre of town, next to the slopes and all the rest of the activities.\r\n\r\nThere are several options for childcare in Pralognan:\r\n- The kids club for children 18 months to 6 years old (indoor activities, educational games, workshops, puppet shows, crafts, face painting, painting, reading, sledging, and snowman building)\r\n- Learning to ski in the ESF (French Ski School) snow garden for kids 3 years old and up\r\n- For children 18 months old and under, there are child-minders to look after the little rascals either for a half day or the whole day.",

There are 40km of marked trails which pass through pine tree forests and snow covered meadows, gently heading up to the Col du Chaussy. A great hike with family or friends, with the cross country skis clipped on, there is no better way to enjoy this peaceful setting.\r\n\r\nOther sensations, other delights... Saint Francois Longchamp has a multitude of activities on offer away from skis: dogsled rides, paragliding initiations, speedriding, walks and snowshoe hiking or a trip to the cinema or a visit to the museum which tells all about the life of the local Felicien peasants of yesteryear.\r\n\r\nFor fans of well-being and simply relaxing, the fitness centre in Saint-Francois Longchamp will be of interest to you.

Regional products and local specialties will make your evenings even more warm, lively and enjoyable.",

On the paths, trails, freeride spots or in the snowpark, whatever you choose you'll be overlooked by a picturesque Mont Blanc. Enjoy hot air ballooning, paragliding or the Tramway du Mont Blanc, just a taste of the myriad of activities offered at St. Gervais that allow you to indulge your every whim.\r\n\r\nThe Tramway du Mont Blanc is one of the last three narrow-gauge railways in France today. In the winter it allows access to skiing in Prarion / Bellevue (1800 m). In the summer taking you to the foot of Bionnassay Glacier at Nid d'Aigle situated at 2372 m in altitude. From there, experienced and well equipped mountaineers enjoy access to the Tete Rosse and the Gouter mountain huts where they rest before the ascension of Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nBesides skiing and mountaineering, St. Gervais is also known for its thermal baths. Since 1806, the Baths of St. Gervais-les-Bains have been reputed for the treatment of dermatological conditions. The treatments use the Saint-Gervais-les-Bains natural thermal water which has anti-inflammatory qualities, gently soothing and healing the skin. In addition, St. Gervais-les-Bains baths show characteristics of dual pathology that treat Asthma and Eczema, both very common in children.",

        "description": "As the traditional home of the Haute Savoie's stone mason trade, Samoens has now established itself as a leader in ski resort excellence. The ski town has a great ski area that joins into the larger Grand Massif and a beautiful, authentic Savoyard village.\r\n\r\nThe 8 person Grand Massif Express gondola departs from the village, in only 8 minutes skiers reach the 1600 metre high alpine plateau which is the doorway to the Grand Massif and one of the finest and well preserved ski areas in France with 265 km of marked ski runs.\r\n\r\nThe ski slopes of Samoëns, situated within the Grand Massif ski area, are characterised by\r\n- Black slopes up high, reserved for established skiers\r\n- Intermediate Freestyle Zone open to the general public with is made up of different runs for all abilities and also an welcoming chalet.\r\n- A newly redesigned beginners area.\r\n\r\nFor the less adventurous skiers there is the legendary Cascades run. At 14km long, novices can ski from the summit of the Grandes Platières at 2500m down to the village of Sixt Fer à Cheval, 1700m lower down. The ski run is a veritable journey through the high alpine pastures and ancient forests. It is also one of the most beautiful ski runs in the whole of the Alps. Don't be surprised to run into the local Chamois along the way!\r\n\r\nFor cross country skiers Samoens has the Vallée du Haut Giffre Nordic ski area. It is divided into two different areas:\r\n- On the valley floor, the trails begin in Samoëns and end at the bottom of the Cirque du Fer à Cheval in Sixt (46km of trails)\r\n- The other at the Col de Joux Plane, 1600 metres high and 13 km from Samoëns (access by car or shuttle from Samoëns)\r\n\r\nFor those seeking above-all action and adrenaline, Samoëns offers a wide range of activities other than skiing; speedriding, ice climbing, snowmobiling, paragliding, helicopter flights to name but a few.\r\n\r\nFor those looking for a bit of time out and ultimately a relaxing break, Samoëns is full of ideas: Nordic walking, Afghan walking, yoga, Ayurvedic massage, reflexology, sensory gym, steam room, traditional massages, whirlpool baths, tai chi chuan, shiatsu or even “Zen” hiking. There is enough to relax and rejuvenate even the most stressed among us.\r\n\r\nFinally, for the more contemplative people, Samoëns is a great place to be to discover the history and heritage of the Giffre Valley, either through local produce tasting sessions (cheeses, meats, wines and spirits of the Savoie) or through chapel visits, wandering in the local alpine botanical garden, Jaÿsinia, or even little trips and tours by train and coach.\r\n\r\nTo help you make the most of all these activities, Samoëns has a range of childcare services from the nursery \"Les Loupiots\" that welcomes children aged 3 months to 6 years old (several play rooms, activity rooms and a special children's restaurant).",

Val d&rsquo;Is&egrave;re has something for skiers and boarders of all levels: Olympic and World Cup runs, a wealth of fantastic off-piste opportunities and a varied selection of pistes including greens high up on the mountain.\r\nThe base of Val d'Is&egrave;re sits at&nbsp;1850&nbsp;metres and from there, the pistes climb up to&nbsp;3488&nbsp;metres, at&nbsp;the&nbsp;Pointe du Montet&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Pissaillas glacier, just below at 3450 metres. Skiers have a choice of 150 kilometres of pistes for all levels, serviced by 90 lifts.\r\nVal d'Isere is part of the&nbsp;Espace Killy ski area, shared with&nbsp;Tignes. Some of the world's best skiers leave their tracks here and the resort has hosted&nbsp;Olympic&nbsp;and&nbsp;World Cup&nbsp;downhill competitions, as well as the&nbsp;Alpine Ski World Championships.\r\nBest for: Intermediates and above\r\nVal d'Isere really is a great all-round resort.&nbsp;Beginners&nbsp;and&nbsp;intermediates&nbsp;will find about 55% of its runs are either green or blue. The resort also has five beginner zones, two of which are large \"ski tranquil\" areas, criss-crossed with easy runs.Of course,&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;skiers will find all the slope they need to push their skills to the limits, thanks to legendary runs like the incredibly steep La Face, used for the men's Olympic downhill. The most challenging run, La For&ecirc;t, cuts through the trees and is ideal for mogul fans.\r\nFreestylers&nbsp;can also get their kicks in the famous Oakley ValPark, which like the rest of the resort, offers something for all levels. Val d'Isere is linked to neighbouring Tignes; the two resorts combine to form the giant Espace Killy ski area.\r\nHighlights: High-altitude snowsure slopes, a long ski season from late November into first week of May, ski-in/ski-out accommodation, huge selection of varied pistes, fast modern lifts, terrain parks, one of the best lift-served off-piste ski areas in the world, easy access to Tignes.\r\nNon-skiers: Outdoor ice rink,&nbsp;Aquasportif&nbsp;centre with pools, spas and climbing wall, and two Michelin star restaurants:&nbsp;L'Atelier Edmond&nbsp;(two stars) and&nbsp;La Table de l'Ours&nbsp;(one star).\r\nNearest airports: Chambery (145km/2hrs), Geneva (223km/2hrs50)\r\nNearest station: Bourg-St-Maurice (30km/40mins). Regular buses run from station\r\nApr&egrave;s / Nightlife\r\nVal d'Is&egrave;re is known for its nightlife, so get apr&egrave;s ski started at&nbsp;La Ros&eacute;e Blanche, which is just at the foot of the La Daille. It's a quiet option, where you can sip Val's best vin chaud and watch the last skiers make their way down the mountain.Otherwise, the&nbsp;M Bar&nbsp;at the Tsanteleina Hotel sets the mood with lounge music, champagne cocktails, and dimmed lighting. The bar also has free wifi, in case you want to take a little time to connect with loved ones back home to recount your exploits on the pistes.To finish the night on a hot note, there's&nbsp;Dick's Tea Bar, which has been a staple of Val d'Is&egrave;re nightlife for 30 years. It came under new management in 2010-2011 and underwent renovations. Now guests party in a cool Nordic atmosphere, bathed in blue, turquoise, and violet light. International DJs regularly rock the dance floor, so check their website for the programme.",

        "description": "Purpose built in the 1960s in a large bowl of powder&nbsp;facing West&nbsp;and aptly nicknamed the big snowy bowl,&nbsp;Flaine&nbsp;offers the widest range of skiing in the Grand Massif ski area.&nbsp; The resort is not the most picturesque of them all and for some visitors the severe architecture is too much to take but if you can ignore the ugly concrete buildings and focus on the fluffy white stuff you&rsquo;ll find a family-friendly resort with excellent facilities. Children are particularly well catered for and good deals can be found on family lift passes. The village centre is mainly car free, compact and convenient.\r\nIn spite of its dreary reputation, Flaine is regarded as a cultural landmark in France having been designed in the Bauhuas style by celebrated architect Marcel Breuer. &nbsp;As a result, the resort is a hub for modern arts and at the bottom of the slopes there&rsquo;s a range of art by abstract artists, the most notable piece being a large Picasso sculpture of a woman&rsquo;s head.\r\nThe resort has, in recent years, undergone a number of refurbishments, and is now making something of a comeback. The Totem, a hotel originally designed by Breuer, has been revamped and rebranded as the ultra-cool and minimimalist Hotel Terminal Neige Totem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAmong Flaine&rsquo;s many attractions, and foremost is the great skiing on offer, is that it&rsquo;s a resort that won&rsquo;t break the bank.&nbsp; There are plenty of low-cost accommodation options available (the new Totem Hotel has competitive rates) designed to appeal to a hip crowd of skiers who are more appreciative of Flaine&rsquo;s artistic credentials than previous visitors. &nbsp;Newer chalet style accommodation is also available.\r\nThe main resort is small&nbsp; and made up of two areas accessible by lifts called the red and black devils. Forum is the busier andlower of the two at 1600m while bigger&nbsp;For&ecirc;t, up the hillside,&nbsp;is located at 1700m. The latter has its own shops and bars. There are also some rather nice traditional villages in the outlying area; Samo&euml;ns, Les Carroz and Morillon offer additional lodging options and generally better dining.\r\nThe skiing in the Flaine bowl is mainly open, but the lowest runs are wooded. Outside the bowl, above Les Carroz, Morillon and Samo&euml;ns the situation is reversed and most of the slopes are below the treeline.\r\nIn town there are various activities to partake in but nightlife and evening apres ski tend to be quiet with most people preferring to stay in their chalets.",

        "description": "The small, scenic village of La Clusaz (1100m) offers access to a surprisingly large ski area straddling five mountains. Its 132km of primarily intermediate slopes are set both above and below the treeline (1000-2600m), making it both interesting and varied.\r\nThe 132km of ski slopes are particularly well suited to intermediates, but the resort is also fast becoming one of the big names on the freeriding scene.\r\nThere&rsquo;s something to occupy all abilities, from nursery slopes to awesome freeriding (which makes up for the lack of advanced/expert slopes). In fact, La Clusaz is fast becoming one of the big names on the European freeriding scene. Its five interlinked sectors make for wide-ranging skiing with engaging off-piste sections set against the dramatic backdrops of the Massif de Balme and Massif de L&rsquo;Aiguille.\r\nThe ski resort has one of the biggest vertical drops: from the summit of Balme to the village there is more than 1500m of altitude to ski. A shuttle bus service also links La Clusaz to Le Grand Bornand and with a Massif des Aravis ski pass, you can access an impressive 220km of slopes. While La Clusaz still has a few slow, old chairs and drags it is however home to the world&rsquo;s first Telemix lift, combining chairs and gondolas.\r\nThe ski scene has grown up around this traditional mountain village complete with a pretty square and Savoyard church. An outdoor market sells local produce every Monday in La Place de l&rsquo;Eglise. Busy streets fan out from the square, each lined with tasteful shops, bars and hotels.&nbsp;\r\nGeneva Airport is an hour&rsquo;s drive, offering a good alternative to Chamonix. The TGV rail station at Annecy is 20 miles.",

        "name": "La Plagne",
        "description": "La Plagne is big - one of the biggest ski resorts in the world - and while some of its architecture may not be the prettiest, it is surrounded by stunning scenery high on a plateau on the edge of the Parc r&eacute;gionale. La Plagne is made up of six high-altitude resorts and four further down the mountain. A few of the villages are very attractive, most noteably Belle Plagne. La Plagne's six altitude resorts containing the bulk of the accommodation, are all around 2,000m. There's plenty of ski-in/ski-out accommodation and none are further than 100m from the slopes.\r\nLa Plagne highlights: Plenty of wide, gentle slopes, ski-in/ski-out accommodation, reliable snowfall due to altitude, easy-to-reach powder-packed off-piste, huge choice of restaurants\r\nSki area is best for: Intermediates, families, freeriders\r\nLa Plagne's 225km of local slopes join with Les Arcs to make the giant 425km Paradiski area. 80 percent of La Plagne's ski runs are above 2,000m and reach up to the Glacier de Belle C&ocirc;te (3,250m). The 130 local ski runs are split into 18 black, 33 red, 69 blue and 10 green. If that is not enough there is the Vanoise Express, which links up with Les Arcs in just under four minutes, offering access to another 235km of runs.\r\nBeginner/intermediate skiers: The facilities for children are first class and each village resort has its own childminding centre and snow play area where the children can learn to ski through play. La Plagne is a great resort to learn to ski and develop quickly into an intermediate skier and beyond. In each of the six altitude villages there are a number of runs coded violet for absolute beginners with free mini ski lifts.\r\nBelle Plagne has a magic carpet for beginners in the resort. Once you graduate to blue runs most of the resort is open to you and you can ski down from the top of the Grande Rochette and Les Verdons to Plagne centre or even from the top of the Belle Cote (3,417m) down to Belle Plagne via the Roche de Mio.\r\nThere is a great short blue run on the glacier right at the top and if you want to you can come down in the cable car. It is a marvellous spot to enjoy the great views all over the Alps around you. For skiers who enjoy a well groomed ski surface this too is the resort for you. The runs are wide and perfectly maintained - great ski &lsquo;motorways' all over the resort.\r\nExpert skiers: Advanced skiers have access to a vast, awesome off-piste ski area. To get the greatest benefit from your stay get yourself a guide. This is not just for off-piste but to get the best of the ski runs. Your guide will help you avoid the crowds and find the best powder, whether it is on the north face of Bellec&ocirc;te (3,200m), on the strikingly beautiful descent of the Cul du Nant glacier or in the forests that lead down to the villages of Bozel and Macot.\r\nA good circuit to start with is around the summit above Plagne Bellec&ocirc;te, the Mont Saint Jacques. Start from the top of the L'Arpette ski lift, pass the T&ecirc;te d'Arpette on the left hand as you face it. You will then arrive at the col between it and the Mont Saint Jacques. From there the descent of the Combe du Grand Clapier gives you excellent snow and a fine view of Mont Blanc. Continue down through the pine For&ecirc;t des Frasses to the La Roche ski lift at Aime La Plagne, a descent of 650 metres.\r\nThe black ski runs are not all pisted so it is a good place to try out your off-piste skills on a ski run that is otherwise marked out and monitored.\r\nThe black/red Mont de la Guerre run is nearly seven kilometres long, from the top of the Les Verdons through some of the La Plagne's most beautiful powder slopes right down to Champagny. The run is marked and secured for safety but not pisted.\r\nFreestylers in La Plagne: The Snowpark de La Plagne is just above Belle Plagne. It is divided up into four zones with differing levels of difficulty for those with little experience of freestyle skiing up to the real pros. The Little Park is conveniently placed in Belle Plagne with a half-pipe and two freestyle areas that enable everyone to find their own level on different units at different levels of difficulty. The Freestyle Park Initiation Fun Zone for the young beginners at Plagne Montalbert in a safe area with bumps, a bordercross track, rails, tables and the chance to try slalom in parallel. A whole new world of winter sports to learn at your own pace.\r\nNon-skiers: Bobsleighing, Super Tyro zip-line, E-fat bikes, paragliding, ice skating.\r\nApres-ski: The resort is not famed for its apres, but Belle Plagne is the liveliest of the villages with the popular late-night disco Le Saloon\r\nNearest airports: Chambery (119km/1hr35), Geneva (197km/2hrs15), Grenoble (192km/2hrs10), Lyon St. Exupery (196km/2hrs15)\r\nNearest station: Aime for Belle Plagne, Plagne Centre and Montalbert; Champagny for Mo&ucirc;tiers; Landry for Montchavin-Les Coches. All between 10 and 30 minutes.\r\nSix-day ski pass: &euro;265",

        "description": "Le Corbier is a Savoyard ski resort in the Maurienne Valley area of the French Alps. Le Corbier was built as a “third generation” resort optimised for child, pedestrian and skier's safety. The safety concern in ski resorts has led to the idea that the construction of buildings right at the foot of the ski lifts which separate as much as possible cars, pedestrians and skiers. It's for this reason the architects in charge of the construction of Le Corbier constructed the now somewhat famous timber buildings of Cosmos, Soyuz and the Baikonur which have become emblematic of Le Corbier. \r\n\r\nToday, Le Corbier has a great warm, family atmosphere. The resort has around eleven thousand beds and likes to boast about its great facilities: it's a 100% genuine ski resort developed and built for one purpose – skiing. The vast majority of the buildings in Le Corbier include a shopping arcade on the ground floor, connecting them to each other. \r\n\r\nThe Le Corbier ski resort is right at the heart of the Sybelles, the fourth largest ski area in France with 310 kilometres of ski runs. It's on the Mont Ouillon (2431 m), the highest pasture in Europe which links Le Corbier with neighbouring ski villages (Saint Sorlin d'Arves Saint Jean d'Arves, La Toussuire, Les Bottières and St Colomban des Villards). For those who just love exceptional views the Sybelles ski area offers a range of ski runs for all abilities which go up to 2620 metres above sea level and look over; The Aiguilles d'Arves, the Etendard glacier on the Meije and the Belledonne mountains! \r\n\r\nIn the Ouillon area of the resort, next to the Torret ski lifts, the snow park is open to all skiers and snowboarders, from beginners to advanced (border cross, freestyle area ...). \r\n\r\nIt's worth a note that there is a “mini snow-park” which serves as a beginners practice area, located on the bottom of the Combe ski run. \r\n\r\nFor amateur cross country skiers, the towns of Villarebert, Le Corbier, Fontcouverte and La Toussuire have 25 km of cross country skiing tracks (groomed and maintained regularly). The tracks are not monitored and access is free. \r\n\r\nLe Corbier offers a comprehensive range of activities \"off-ski”; snowmobiling, paragliding, tobogganing, speed-riding, dog sledding, movies, relaxation centre, a spa “Galaxie Spa”, a swimming pool and a fitness centre. There is something for both athletes and amateurs who are in need of a place to let their hair down. \r\n\r\nFor children from 3 to 5 years old, the snow garden is an ideal location to teach them how to make their first turns on skis; the atmosphere is fun and is supervised by specialised instructors. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the nursery welcomes children from 6 months to 5 years; they offer either full day or half day programs which include a range of games, crafts... (And possibly a nap!) \r\n\r\nTake a true ski resort; add an outstanding ski area, easily accessible for all abilities, build it at the heart of the massive Sybelles ski area, add a healthy dose of convenience and easy accessibility with a covered shopping mall connecting all the buildings in town. Then sprinkle in a great atmosphere, with entertainment for all ages. Finally, mix in a family for a week of holidays and you get Le Corbier.",

        "description": "Right in the middle of the Haute-Savoie department of France lies the Massif des Aravis. Situated between Annecy, Chamonix and Geneva, The Grand-Bornand has all the charm of a traditional mountain village and equally all the modern amenities of a world class ski resort. The Grand-Bornand has preserved its mountain soul while developing a quality reception that makes people come back year after year.\r\n\r\nThe resort of the Grand Bornand is separated in to two villages, each at different altitudes:\r\n- At 1000 metres, the Grand-Bornand village, a typical Savoyard village with its central village square, its' church and range of shops.\r\n- Six kilometres higher up, on the road to the Col de la Colombiere you'll come across The Grand-Bornand Chinaillon situated at 1300 metres above sea level; it is the main departure for the ski slopes.\r\n\r\nThe easy, welcoming snow covered pastures like those found at the top of the ‘col des Annes' make up a large percentage of the ski area in the Grand Bornard, however the slopes of the Aravis Mountains or the Mont Lachat offer harder skiing for those more experienced. Beginner or pro, newbies to winter sports or old timers, the 90 km of ski runs that cover the area will meet the requirements of everyone. There is even an array of walking paths for those who choose not to ski.\r\n\r\nThe 90 kilometres of connected skiing accessible from the Grand-Bornand Village (1000 m) or Grand-Bornand Chinaillon (1300 m), extend in a North / South format guaranteeing lots of sunshine and abundant snowfall, with the weather systems are often caught by the Aravis mountain chain.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the Maroly area of the resort, the Grand-Bo snow park (ranked among the best in France) has something for everyone: small and big, young and old, beginner to experienced professional.\r\n\r\nIn the Bouchet valley and up at the top of Chinaillon near the old village, cross country skiing has a stronghold. The huge snow covered spruce trees cover the snug little chalets nestled in the middle of this winter wilderness. 60km of perfectly groomed tracks lead all the way to La Clusaz, which is home to the tough, black rated Frasses track.\r\n\r\nFor non-skiers, the Grand Bornand offers a range of sporting, leisure and cultural activities:\r\n-Hiking or snowshoeing, paragliding, hot air ballooning. Ice climbing, horse riding (skijoring), snowmobiling and ice skating are all available throughout the season.\r\n- For those in need of time to relax, there is a Library and a cinema.\r\n- For those culture vultures, discover how the locals make their famous Reblochon cheese, enjoy a guided tour of the local area and explore the local heritage centre.\r\n\r\nAfter a good day of skiing or walking, take the time to share a bit of time with the kids in the “Espace P'tits Montagnards” (Little Mountaineers) area, which is specially adapted for families and situated in the centre of town.",

It is located only 120 km northwest of Prague and in close proximity to the border on Germany and Oberwiesenthal centre. Traditionally throughout the season it offers excellent snow conditions on 12 km downhill courses of all difficulty levels, spread on about 35 hectares that are 80% secured with technical snow.\r\n\r\nBefore the coming season the resort has undergone a major modernization and skiers and snowboarders can expect a number of innovations. Several ski lifts were replaced by a modern and fast four- chair cable car with the protective covers as the only one in the Czech Republic. At the same time there were prolonged and extended the downhill coursesl courses and was strengthened the system for covering with snow. Then was installed a new system of cash desks and check -in system, which enabled the introduction of multi-day common tickets with the neighbouring resort Oberwiesenthal in the FRG.\r\nOn Klínovec you will find 3 chairlifts and 7 ski lifts. There is a snowpark with the first -class U ramp of class FIS Superpipe and also 30 km of groomed trails.\r\nWe do not forget the little children. We will look after them and they will find entertainment in the baby skipark with free ski lift. Families will appreciate a wide range of family tickets.\r\nOther services are Ski schools, equipment rentals, restaurant, snack-bar and the bar umbrella.\r\nOf course there is parking for 700 cars free of charge",

But there are also lifts and pistes available for more experienced skiers. There is also a fun park available for snowboarders.  \r\n",

Zum anderen garantiert er insbesondere Anfängern schnelle Erfolgserlebnisse auf dem Board wie auf Skiern. Originalität zwischen Himmel und Schnee  Mächtige Balken, eine Doppelfeuer- Esse mit Zugblasebalg, ein offener Kamin – wer in der „Köhler-Hütte“ Platz nimmt, sitzt inmitten einer alten Schmiede von 1850 und dem Fachwerk eines Winterberger Bauernhauses von 1792. Und hat ganzjährig viel zu gucken: Denn die Remise mit den vielen sehenswerten Details und Blick auf Sonnenterrasse und Skihang kann auch außerhalb der Skisaison für Veranstaltungen ab 30 Personen gebucht werden  Guter Ausgangspunkt für Langläufer, ob Hunauspur oder Skilanglaufzentrum Westfeld – der Sahnehang bietet Langläufern einen perfekten Einstieg in die vernetzten Loipen der Nachbarorte.

The impressive mountain landscape and the wide and broad hillsides make for an interesting ski area and an exciting winter vacation. \r\n\r\nThe ski area offers nearly endless slopes for all levels of difficulty and the pistes are well-groomed. The ski area Sudelfeld is especially suitable for families and beginners, but professionals will also get their money’s worth on the demanding slopes at the Waldkopf (FIS snowboarding world cup slope) to the Rosengasse. \r\n\r\nA shuttle takes the guests from the railway station directly to the ski area. There are also numerous free parking-lots available. Modern snowmaking equipment, professional skiing schools and many offers for children and child-care complete the programme in the ski area.    \r\n",

The starting point for everyone who comes to Narvik to ski is Fagernesfjellet. The skiing area starts near the village at 200m, and the ski lifts take you up to 1000m in 10-15 minutes. The spectacular view from the top of the slopes is unique, since the runs go almost all the way down to the fjord. A gondola going paralell to the ski lifts takes you directly to the mountain restaurant at 600m. If you want to experience the northern lights (Aurora Borealis), the season for that is from November to March.&nbsp;Due to the dark period in December and January, the period from March to June is considered high season for skiing in Narvik.&nbsp;",

From the youngest guests playing in the children&rsquo;s area to those looking for well-groomed slopes and virgin powder snow.\r\nThe ski centre has seven lifts, 15 slopes, a ski school and a range of activities for guests of all ages. There are also plenty of well-groomed cross-country trails connected to the ski centre and a magnificent area for ski touring and beautiful cross-country terrain. The newly-opened Myrkdalen Hotel is perfectly situated at the foot of the ski centre, only a snowball&acute;s throw from the ski lift.\r\nWe will be expanding our range of activities for younger guests this season with an improved children&rsquo;s area and our new forest trail. Throughout the season we offer a variety of choice for children, with child-care and children&acute;s competitions, exciting courses and evening entertainment. We have also established a new training area for enthusiasts who simply love fresh snow, where they can learn how to use avalanche beacons. This area can be found approximately 200 meters from where you exit the chairlift. Simply enter the required level of difficulty and you&rsquo;re off!\r\nSki School\r\nThe ski school at Voss Fjellandsby offers a range of activities and skiing tuition. We have instructors of all ages, with a variety of professional backgrounds in addition to their formal education as instructors from The Norwegian Ski School.

The architects were inspired by international mountain hotels in Austria and Switzerland, which is reflected in both the interiors and the amenities offered. At Myrkdalen Hotel, you will feel like a guest at a hotel of a high international standard, but you won't find hospitality like ours anywhere else.\r\n The hotel has spacious rooms and stylish furnishings with pleasing colours and high-quality furniture. Most rooms can accommodate four people or more. All rooms have stunning views of either the mountains or the beautiful scenery of the Myrkdalen valley. Some rooms have their own balcony. All rooms also have a flat screen TV, a desk and bathroom.  There are three different restaurants at the hotel. A family restaurant serving pizza and pasta. The open kitchen has a stone oven to ensure that your Italian pizza is of the very best quality. A fondue restaurant, inspired by the Swiss cuisine. The hotel's head chef has been to Switzerland and learned the secret behind a good fondue. The main restaurant has an &agrave; la carte menu that focuses on good local produce with a European touch.   Myrkdalen Hotel also has a cosy reception area with a bar, and an apr&egrave;s-ski bar with live music and a DJ. There is also a separate playing room for the kids and a game room with Playstation, Wii and Xbox.\r\n",

        "description": "Big names, ski pioneers and the high society &ndash; but also Tyrolean down-to-earthness, Gem&uuml;tlichkeit and hospitality: these contrasts are what make Kitzb&uuml;hel one of the greatest ski resorts in the Alps. Kitzb&uuml;hel is even recognised as the &ldquo;Best Ski Resort in the World&rdquo; for 2013. With 51 cable cars and lifts, connecting 170 kilometres of ski slopes, Bergbahn AG Kitzb&uuml;hel is one of the largest cable car companies in Austria. In addition to the spectacular &ldquo;Streif&rdquo;, Kitzb&uuml;hel trumps with a variety of ski runs suiting all sizes and ski styles. In fact, the vast and snow-reliable ski resort boasts an above-average number of family runs (69 km easy, 77 km intermediate, 24 km difficult). The &ldquo;flagship&rdquo; run is, of course, the Family Streif, which elegantly snakes its way around the extremely steep part of the downhill course, before returning to the original racing track at the Seidlalm, dodging the &ldquo;Hausbergkante&rdquo; ridge on the incline Ganslernhang and ends up back at the usual finish. Don&rsquo;t miss out on the most spectacular lift in the world: the 3S-Umlaufbahn (tri-cable gondola). It spans the 2.5-kilometre wide and 400-meter deep Saukaser Valley between the mountains Pengelstein and the Wurzh&ouml;he. Snowboarders and freeskiers will also find their perfect playground on the Resterh&ouml;he. The experienced QParks team lead by Franz Lechner is responsible for the setup of the Hanglalm Park as well as for the park on the Kitzb&uuml;heler Horn, including all kicker, rail, jib and tree lines, picnic tables and chill-out areas. Skiers and boarders keen to head off-piste will love Kitzb&uuml;hel&rsquo;s 200 km2 backcountry. Around the 32 kilometres of ski routes there are endless opportunities to ride through perfect deep powder snow. After dark, the 700-year-old &ldquo;Old Town&rdquo; with its typical apr&egrave;s ski bars and pubs becomes the social hub of the world. Fashionistas will be in their element hopping between international designer addresses, from Bogner and Boss, Gucci, D&amp;G and Moncler, to Prada and Louis Vuitton. And between them, classic Kitzb&uuml;hel &ldquo;fashion originals&rdquo;, such as Sportalm, Frauenschuh, Franz Prader and Helmut Eder, add a traditional element to the vibrant collection. The &ldquo;town of the chamois&rdquo;, as Kitzb&uuml;hel is affectionately known, is easily accessible by road and by rail. From the airport cities Munich, Salzburg, and Innsbruck, it takes a maximum of one and a half hours by car to get to Kitzb&uuml;hel.",

A few steps from the village in the heart of a beautiful landscaped park, the Saint-Lary thermal baths combine technicality and comfort.

As well as the superb pistes providing ample mellow skiing, Obertauern is also a freeride Mecca with some challenging steep trails with cliffs. For added excitement there is night skiing and snow-kiting, while a more romantic option is the horse-drawn sleigh ride...",

The resort is located about 49 miles (78km) south of Marrakech and is the highest ski resort in Africa. Standing at over 3,000 metres (over 9,500 feet) and offering up to 10km of skiable slopes, visitors are a mix of both tourists and local skiers.<br><br>There are seven lifts in Oukaïmeden that run for all abilities, including six drag-lifts that service the beginner’s nursery slope and the intermediate-level slopes; and a slow single chairlift to the more advanced slope. The intermediate slopes are much more attractive and have fairly tamed conditions, but the difficulty of each run varies a lot depending on the hill. At the bottom of the lifts, you will find a well-kept nursery slope that provides a better environment for beginner’s-level skiing, together with a large family sledding area.<br><br>The resort offers a small selection of runs, with the longest being just over 2 miles (3km), and the runs from the top of the chairlift being the most challenging. This is where the snow can feel like hard off-piste ice in some sections as you descend. These runs are not particularly easy and are best suited to high-intermediate to advanced-level skiers.",

        "description": "Morocco is known by exotic-skiing cognoscenti as the best skiing destination in Africa, but the high, snow-catching slopes of the Atlas Mountains extend from Morocco into Algeria as well. It was here, 43 miles south of the capital city of Algiers in the Tell Atlas subrange, that French colonialists established Africa’s first ski area in the 1940s. Sitting at 5,000 feet in what is now Chréa National Park, the Chréa ski area may have only had 295 feet of vertical drop, but the Atlas cedar forest was beautiful, a welcoming Tudor lodge awaited at the base, and every weekend its slopes filled with French skiers and their families.<br><brBut Chréa had a secret. Unbeknownst to the French, the mountain was also a clandestine base for independence fighters who were plotting for their country’s freedom. Their victory came in 1962, when Algeria won its independence. The French promptly left en masse, abandoning their beloved ski area. Algerians, however, quickly learned to love the foreign sport, maintaining the ski area and even installing a four-and-a-half-mile gondola to Chréa from the nearby city of Bilda in 1984.<br><br>Except Chréa’s time as a conflict zone wasn’t over. An Algerian civil war erupted in 1992, and the little ski area became a military base once again, this time housing the radical Armed Islamic Group. When the war ended in 2002, the lodge and lifts had been destroyed. Skiing in Algeria was over, or so it seemed.<br><br>Then the Algerian government and ski community began rebuilding. A rope tow on Chréa’s main run was restored. The rebuilt gondola from Bilda returned to operation in 2009. Locals built handmade tea stands at the base. Local youth signed up for the revived Algerian national race team, and one skier even went to the Vancouver Olympics in 2010. Today, Chréa is back and Algeria is a skiing country once again.",

Firstly there are no ski patrollers chasing you when you head off-piste, and there’s no imposing Prince Hotel at the base area as with Naeba, Furano, Shizukuishi, and Yakebitaiyama at Shiga Kogen. The little village at the base of the Suginohara Ski Resort is called Suginosawa Onsen, and there are no towering hotels and it’s retained its Japanese flavour.

These services are offered inside the Gulmarg Ski Resort boundaries (Visit our ski maps page). Gulmarg is not your typical ski resort because most of the skiing is off-piste. That does not mean it is more dangerous. Most people come to Gulmarg Ski Resort for the incredible terrain access from the Gulmarg Gondola. It is important to understand that outside the resort boundaries there is no avalanche mitigation and any rescue need to come from your group. We highly recommend skiing Gulmarg with a professional ski guide. It is totally possible to learn skiing or snowboarding in Gulmarg. We work with Gulmarg's best guides and instructors.",

It's also fabulous for those who love to launch in the terrain parks.<br><br>Aomori Spring is emerging as a destination ski resort in its own right, and it's also worth visiting for a few days if you're road tripping in the northern Tohoku area. It's in the vicinity of the renowned Hakkoda, and a trip to Aomori Spring could be particularly good for stormy days when the weather is too brutal at Hakkoda and the Hakkoda ropeway is closed. Or in the height of winter you may be better off staying at Aomori Spring Resort and heading to Hakkoda only if the weather permits.",

The famous Zao snow monsters (aka Juhyo or snow ghosts) are fir trees clumped with ice and snow as a result of the bitter Siberian winds – the bizarre shapes they take on are probably more spectacular than spooky.<br><br>Zao Onsen Japan is not just well known for the snow monsters and the Zao ski resort, but also as an onsen resort town. The distinctive smell of sulphur throughout the town highlights the presence of the many hot springs. Onsens can be found in many of the ryokans (traditional Japanese inns) and there are also public bathhouses and open air hot springs (rotenburo). The therapeutic waters are a great place to soak weary muscles.",

Sapporo Teine Olympia was the site of the bobsled competition for the 1972 Sapporo Olympic Games and it still has various reminders of a bygone era. The Teine Olympia ski area offers delightfully mellow slopes for beginners as well as night skiing. <br><br>Further up the mountain is Sapporo Teine Highland. At 1,000 metres above sea level, the ski area offers spectacular views of Sapporo and the ocean, and whilst standing at the top of one of the black runs you may suddenly develop vertigo. The Highland Zone features some of the steepest in-bounds terrain in Japan.",

Kusatsu Onsen is one of the most famous hot spring towns in Japan. It’s renowned for water that has outstanding healing qualities, so domestic tourists flock there in their droves to gawk at the onsen fields in town and soak in the indoor and outdoor baths.",

Considering the few information found online, a restaurant should be located in one of the building at the bottom of the resort. Some pictures also suggests that the resort is equipped with a snow groomer. NB: The ski resort is closed due to bankruptcy. Although the resort is closed and doesn’t offer great facilities, the surrounding area is a heaven for ski touring.",

Known for its relaxed vibe (locally known as 'Lassig') & huge freeride terrain, Skicircus Saalbach has an impressive 270km of piste trails and a truly vast off-piste. Piste trails, even ones marked blue, are predominantly intermediate in nature, but they are wide & in perfect condition. Take up the Skicircus Challenge - a demanding 68km, 12,000m vertical ski circuit showcasing the entire resort. It does tend to attract a crowd though, so follow your own nose & avoid those busy trails. In the days following fresh snow, a vast off-piste awaits those that are hunting powder. Some challenging steeps and wide-open alpine bowls predominate, but if the snow is deep and low, many opportunities to freeride the meadows and trees down into the valleys present themselves. Beware the odd fence post & other assorted agricultural remnants!",
