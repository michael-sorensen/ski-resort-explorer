The ski area is known for a great alpine experience away from the crowds that you would find at most commercial resorts. Tukino Ski Field is operated by the Tukino Mountain Clubs Association and has an inviting atmosphere and camaraderie that most club ski fields are known for. Tukino is a great destination for families, expert skiers and snowboarders alike.\r\nTukino is open to the public for skiing and riding and also offers cat-skiing, ski-touring and ice climbing. The ski field is sheltered from the westerly winds and often operates in the clear while the rest of Mt. Ruapehu is covered in clouds. Visit Tukino to experience an on-mountain atmosphere reminiscent of what resorts used to be like. ",
