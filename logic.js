  'description': '<p>Best Restaurants &amp; Bars at Heavenly Mountain</h2>\r\n<h3 > For Breakfast</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Red Hut</strong> is a Tahoe breakfast institution with three locations, including the original shop that opened in 1959 and the more conveniently-located new caf&eacute; on the corner of Ski Run and Lake Tahoe boulevards. The omelets are great, but waffles, including bacon waffles with the crispy strips cooked right in, are the house favorite.&amp;</p>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch</h3>\r\n<p>Featuring a towering wall of windows, massive wooden beams, and a modern-mountain design, the <strong>Tamarack Lodge</strong> atop the Heavenly gondola is a model for energy efficiency and pleasing aesthetics. Choose from a selection of foods ranging from pizza to pasta to everything in between, with indoor and outdoor seating.</p>\r\n<p>Named for the legendary youth ski team that produced Glen Plake and other past skiing greats, <strong>Blue Angel Caf&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;is a short drive from the California base and is a favorite local spot due to its innovative menu and affordable prices. Try the curry of the day or the daily True Blue Plate Special, and don&rsquo;t skip the sweet potato fries with homemade aioli.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Dinner</h3>\r\n<p><strong>19 Kitchen Bar</strong> on the 19th floor of Harvey&rsquo;s casino offers some of the best views of the lake, a VIP seating area, hardwood grill and a small but select menu of American seafood and steak specialties. Start with a Tahoe-tini, order the Chilean sea bass or filet mignon, and don&rsquo;t forget the homemade donuts for dessert.</p>\r\n<p>With a spacious and modern d&eacute;cor, the <strong>Edgewood Tahoe Restaurant</strong> provides unimpeded views of Lake Tahoe from every table and is located at the south shore&rsquo;s finest golf course. House favorites include the seared elk steak with sun-dried cherry relish and spaetzle or the marinated bavette steak.</p>\r\n<p>Located near the marina and several art galleries for after-dinner browsing, <strong>Riva Grill</strong> is a local&rsquo;s favorite with d&eacute;cor inspired by Tahoe&rsquo;s summertime wooden boating culture. Cocktails include the famous Wet Woody, and the menu features upscale burgers and fish tacos as well as the signature chimichurri pork tenderloin.</p>\r\n<p>With gourmet pizzas, salads and pasta dishes, <strong>Blue Dog Pizza</strong> is a short walk from Gondola Square in the Raley&rsquo;s shopping plaza, across the street from Heavenly Village.</p>\r\n<h3 > Apr&egrave;s &amp; Nightlife</h3>\r\n<p>Known as a 24-hour party town due to its casino nightclubs, blackjack tables, and drink specials, South Lake Tahoe offers loads of opportunity for naughty nights.</p>\r\n<p><strong>McP&rsquo;s Pub</strong> is a local&rsquo;s hangout with a covered and heated outdoor deck and a wide selection of beers.</p>\r\n<p>Located in Heavenly Village near the skating rink, <strong>Fire + Ice</strong> serves classic and fruity martinis and has an outdoor patio with fire pits for enjoying the sunset.</p>\r\n<p>Late-nighters and bridesmaids on a bender should head to <strong>Opal</strong> in the MontBleu casino, where the music thumps until morning and scantily-clad dancers shimmy on mini-stages beneath flashing lights.</p>'},

  'description': '>Heavenly Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p>First time to Heavenly? These are our suggestions for the best terrain options for every type of skier.</p>\r\n<p>First, lap the Powder Bowl Express lift, hitting the bumps of Waterfall run. Then, take Sky Chair to the summit and swoosh down the fast groomers of Ellie&rsquo;s and High Five. Now, it&rsquo;s time for a short hike. Traverse Sky Line trail (due to its width, Heavenly requires some traversing to get from California to Nevada and back) to the bottom of Milky Way Bowl. Unclick just past the sign on Sky Line Trail, and follow the boot pack up to the summit of Monument Peak, which at 10,067 feet is Tahoe&rsquo;s highest in-bounds terrain. Drop straight down the middle of Milky Way Bowl, or work to skier&rsquo;s right toward Mott and Killebrew canyons.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to avoid the agro conditions in Mott and Killebrew, but need some off-piste fun, check out the tree runs and pillow drops through Nevada Woods and The Burn - where charred trees from a fire provide starkly beautiful views, and powder stashes await those willing to explore. Wrap up with a finishing run down The Face or a tree run through East Bowl Woods back to the California lodge.</p>\r\n<p>Located right out of the California base, The Face is a double-black mogul run unforgiving in its steepness. It drops 1,700 vertical feet into the equally challenging Gunbarrel and East Bowl moguls. These are the bump runs made famous by former hot-dogger Glen Plake, who holds the annual Gunbarrel 25 event here that challenges skiers to complete 25 thigh-burning laps.</p>\r\n<p>The Milky Way Bowl is the best place to find fresh powder for expert skiers. For amazing tree turns, head to the Pinnacles and take some time to dip into the pines. Intermediates should head to Ridge Run and check out the amazing views of Lake Tahoe.</p>\r\n<h3 > Heavenly Mountain Powder Day Strategy</h3>\r\n<p>There are two ways to attack the mountain on a powder day, and the choice really depends on Heavenly&rsquo;s weather and from which side (California or Nevada) you start your ski day. Mild temperatures at Lake Tahoe level can necessitate heading for the top, where snow is lighter. But, if temps are cold down low, then options are bountiful.</p>\r\n<p><strong>California Lodge Route</strong><br />Setting out from Heavenly Ski Resort&rsquo;s California Lodge, take Gunbarrel lift, and bag a quick lap through the well-spaced trees of East Bowl Woods. Ride Gunbarrel lift back up and board the mid-mountain Powder Bowl Express, disembarking to the right for Powder Bowl Woods - an often-overlooked tree stash at mid-mountain. When Powder Bowl Woods are skied out, ride Canyon Express to the top and descend beneath the lift to the trees of Ridge Bowl. Take Sky Express back up and drop down the fall line into the trees to skier&rsquo;s right of Liz&rsquo;s run.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Heavenly Village Route</strong><br />If starting from Heavenly Village, take the gondola to mid-mountain and board Tamarack Express, heading skier&rsquo;s right to access Airies Woods, which drop you out at Dipper Express lift. Ride Dipper to the terminus and ski toward Dipper Woods and Milky Way. By this time, patrol will hopefully have opened the gates to some of Heavenly&rsquo;s best terrain&mdash;Mott Canyon, where skilled skiers can find steep chutes and rock drops. While waiting for Mott to open, hit the Dipper Knob area to skier&rsquo;s right of Meteor trail. Adjacent to Mott is the equally ferocious Killebrew Canyon, typically the last terrain at Heavenly to open, so be prepared to pounce when it does.</p>\r\n<h3 > Groomers &amp; Family Skiing at Heavenly</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly has a large grooming fleet, which means an abundance of groomer options for beginners and intermediates.</p>\r\n<p>From the gondola terminus, take Tamarack Express and do a warm-up lap on California Trail or Sam&rsquo;s Dream. Go back up Tamarack and drop into Orion and the East Peak area, served by the Dipper and Comet chairlifts. Cruise the Comet trail and take the lift back up. This time, ski down Crossover to the Olympic Express lift, which offers a run through the wide-open glades of The Pines.</p>\r\n<p>If starting on the California side, head to the top of Liz&rsquo;s run off the Sky Express lift, making sure to look over your shoulder at Lake Tahoe. Take Sky back up and descend Ridge Run, which offers some of the mountain&rsquo;s most amazing lake views. Stop off to the side and grab a photo.</p>\r\n<h3 > Heavenly Mountain Resort for Beginners</h3>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a beginner and want to explore some higher terrain, go to the Enchanted Forest. With shorter runs and gentle slopes, it&rsquo;s a great place to start.</p>\r\n<p>Beginner skiers and riders can also head for Maggie&rsquo;s run, served by the Powder Bowl Express lift. Maggie&rsquo;s run meanders down to the &ldquo;Snow Beach&rdquo; area, where a small food shack offers hot chocolate and snacks, and beach chairs provide a relaxed setting for families to meet up while doing laps on different lifts.</p>\r\n<p>Newbies who want beginner trails only should stick to the Boulder Lodge area, a little-trafficked ski area within the resort that features a gentle, wide-open bowl for working on turns and skiing with the kids.</p>\r\n<h3 > Heavenly Terrain Park</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly Ski Resort also has multiple terrain parks designed to serve everyone from beginners to go-big huckers.</p>\r\n<p>For first-timers and rookies, the <strong>progression park</strong> near the gondola offers low boxes and rails that are almost flush with the snow to eliminate the fear factor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Groove Park</strong> is the most popular, offering smaller features for beginners and intermediates, though experienced boarders and jibbers often start here with some warm-up runs or to practice moves. Groove is set up like a skate park, with a lot of features packed into a small area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Player&rsquo;s Park</strong> (off Ridge Run) and Ante Up Park (beneath Tamarack Express) are classified as medium/intermediate terrain parks in terms of their features. Player&rsquo;s Park has a line of triple jumps and progressive jibs. Ante Up&rsquo;s claim to fame is a jib line featuring old water pipes and recycled scrap items that provide a unique vibe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>High Roller</strong> is where the fearless go to play, with expert-level hits and gaps that provide a show for people riding the Sky chair. High Roller terrain park has a 55-foot and a 65-foot jump as well as playful touches, such as tire stacks for clearing or tapping on the way by.</p>\r\n<h3 >Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly offers tubing&hellip; and mini tubing! Located at the top of the gondola, their tubing hill is over 500 feet long and has a convenient magic carpet to take you and your tube back up to the top. Shorter riders and young children can enjoy the mini-tubing hill adjacent to the main hill in Adventure Peak.</p>\r\n<h3 >Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>For beautiful views of Lake Tahoe, you&rsquo;ll want to head toward North of South Lake Tahoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Y&rdquo; intersection of Highway 50/89. On the lakeside, you&rsquo;ll find the mostly-flat and short trails at Pope, Kiva, and Baldwin Beaches. West of the &ldquo;Y,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find a number of easy-to-moderate trails along Lake Tahoe Boulevard, Tahoe Mountain Road, and North Upper Truckee Road. From the Echo Lakes/Johnson Pass Sno-Park, you can ski through Desolation Wilderness to Echo Lakes and Lake Aloha for some of the most stunning landscapes in the area.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind, nearly all cross-country ski and snowshoe trails in South Lake Tahoe are on public lands, meaning they&rsquo;re not groomed. Fortunately, many people ski at most locations so there are usually established tracks.</p>'},

  'description': '>Things to Do in South Lake Tahoe</h2>\r\n<h3 > Heavenly Essentials</h3>\r\n<p>Visit one of the many cozy craft breweries and coffee shops in South Lake Tahoe.</p>\r\n<p>Go ice skating at the Heavenly Village outdoor ice skating rink.</p>\r\n<p>Book a snowy winter sleigh ride (complete with wool blankets and hot cocoa) at South Lake&rsquo;s Camp Richardson Corral, which has been leading scenic trail rides since 1934.</p>\r\n<p>Hit up the casino. Because if you went to Nevada and didn&rsquo;t gamble, did you really even go? Four resorts dominate the South Lake Tahoe gambling scene: Harvey&rsquo;s Resort and Casino, Harrah&rsquo;s Lake Tahoe, Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino, and the MontBleu Resort Casino &amp; Spa.</p>\r\n<h3 > Non-skiing Activities</h3>\r\n<p>Experience some of the greatest views of Lake Tahoe with a 2.4-mile Scenic Gondola Ride. Hop on at Heavenly Village and stop at the Observation Deck at the top for panoramic views of Lake Tahoe and the Sierra Nevada mountains.</p>\r\n<p>Ride the Ridge Rider Mountain Coaster. This gravity-powered alpine coaster is open in the winter (ski boots are permitted) and coasts through the forest and natural rock formations. Of course, the views are incredible. The coaster sleds fit up to two riders, so you can enjoy this activity with others.</p>\r\n<p>Head to the top of the Gondola for a guided winter UTV tour. You&rsquo;ll traverse over to Blue Sky Terrace, stopping at highlights along the way for interesting information about the area and beautiful views.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Top Winter Events at Heavenly</h3>\r\n<p>New Year&rsquo;s Eve at Heavenly is an experience you won&rsquo;t want to miss. The annual SnowGlobe Music Festival combines world-famous musicians with the world&rsquo;s best snow conditions. Heavenly&rsquo;s Gondola Ball Drop and fireworks start at 9:00 pm, in time for the midnight Ball Drop in New York City&rsquo;s Time Square. The party continues into the night at one of the many casino nightclubs.</p>\r\n<p>South Lake Tahoe&rsquo;s Spring Loaded event brings together the best of spring and winter with live music, loud outfits, lodging specials, and restaurant deals for three weeks of sun and fun. Festivities include on-mountain events at Heavenly Mountain Resort, Kirkwood Mountain, Sierra-at-Tahoe, happy hour specials, mid-week entertainment, and live events and guest performers.</p>\r\n<h3 > Ski School</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly offers lessons for children, teens, and adults. You can also choose from small group sessions, private guided experiences, and more to fit your needs.</p>\r\n<h3 > Child Care</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly Day Care is a licensed child care center for children ages 6 weeks to 6 years, with an optional ski component for children ages 3-5 years.

 {'tab': 'mountain_overview',
  'description': '<p>Palisades Tahoe Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Palisades Tahoe Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p>Palisades Tahoe can look intimidating to beginners due to the steep terrain right out of the village. The High Camp Cable Car, also called the Tram, rises up and over the Tram Face, virtually un-skiable terrain where Palisades Tahoe holds an extreme competition yearly for the world&rsquo;s elite. But don&rsquo;t be fooled: there are fantastic beginner runs located at mid-mountain.</p>\r\n<p>Take a leap of faith and ride the tram to High Camp, where four lifts offer mellow groomed beginner and intermediate trails. The payoff is extraordinary lake views as well as the feeling that you are high in the mountains and away from the run-of-the-mill, lower-mountain slopes that most ski resorts provide for newbies.</p>\r\n<p>Palisades Tahoe will never win any awards for its tree skiing - there simply isn&rsquo;t that much due to the mountain&rsquo;s vast open expanses - but those who seek a forested environment should head to the Palisades Tahoe and Red Dog lifts as well as the lower sections of Granite Chief.</p>\r\n<h3 > High Camp &amp; SnoVentures Activity Zone</h3>\r\n<p>High Camp is a mountaintop meadow tucked between high peaks where experts can get an adrenaline fix before meeting up with less skilled family members for lunch. High Camp has a swimming pool and skating rink as well as outdoor seating, providing an inspiring setting for all ability levels.</p>\r\n<p>For young children, the Papoose beginner&rsquo;s area is on the far eastern side of the parking lot beside the SnoVentures Activity Zone, where you will find mini snowmobiles for kids and snow tubing for all ages. This is the learning ground for first-timers, complete with free hot chocolate.</p>\r\n<h3 > Palisades Tahoe Route</h3>\r\n<p>For intermediates, Palisades Tahoe offers uncrowded runs and beautiful lake views, with groomers that loop down to the Resort at Palisades Tahoe on the far looker&rsquo;s left of the resort. Palisades Tahoe offers classic American skiing, with trails cut through the trees&mdash;something you don&rsquo;t get much of in the wide-open expanses of Palisades Tahoe.</p>\r\n<p>Skiers and riders can access upper-mountain intermediate terrain via the Shirley Lake Express, a fast, six-pack chairlift perfect for doing laps. The Gold Coast six-pack lift provides advanced intermediate runs. Round out the day with some laps on the Solitude lift, which drops down from High Camp into groomed and ungroomed intermediate runs, glades and tree islands.</p>\r\n<h3 > Granite Peak Trail</h3>\r\n<p>For skiers who like to hike, Palisades Tahoe has bountiful options. Granite Peak, accessed via Granite Chief, is the ski resort&rsquo;s highest point at just over 9,000 feet, so it loads well on powder days and offers lots of secret stashes days after a storm. Hidden Bowl features steep wide-open terrain and tree shots, making this area prime for exploration.</p>\r\n<h3 > Palisade Chutes</h3>\r\n<p>The Palisades chutes are some of the most infamous &ldquo;Squallywood&rdquo; terrain, featured in countless ski films. If you go big here, lots of chairlift riders will be watching and cheering. Access Palisades expert terrain via the Siberia Express, but be prepared to handle a cornice drop. Lesser-seasoned skiers should stick to the easiest of the Palisades chutes, National Chute to looker&rsquo;s left. Named for Olympian Jonny Mosely, Mosley\'s Run is a severely steep bump run that Jonny credits with giving him the skills to handle the world&rsquo;s toughest moguls competitions.</p>\r\n<h3 > Palisades Tahoe Beginner Trails</h3>\r\n<p>Big Blue is pure bliss for true beginners or for those who need to warm up before hitting it big. The terrain is easy to access using the Aerial Tram up to High Camp. From there, visitors can access the gently sloped terrain of Bailey&rsquo;s Beach and Gold Coast. The Big Blue area even offers the Belmont terrain park designed to introduce beginner and intermediate skiers to park ski and riding.</p>\r\n<h2>Alpine Meadows Ski Area</h2>\r\n<p>The terrain on the Alpine Meadows side of the ski resort consists of wide-open bowls, long groomed slopes and abundant natural features within its 2,400 skiable acres. The ski area&rsquo;s front and backsides boast plenty of beginner, intermediate, and advanced options.</p>\r\n<h3 > Pacific Crest North Bowls</h3>\r\n<p>Alpine Meadows offers some of the best skiing and riding in Lake Tahoe with the Pacific Crest Bowls, offering backcountry access to expert skiers with the proper equipment. Take the short (or long) hike or traverse out to one of these bowls, and then end up back at a high-speed chairlift. From the summit of Ward Peak, visitors can take in spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and Lake Tahoe.</p>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Meadows Beginner and Intermediate Ski Trails</h3>\r\n<p>Beginner and intermediate skiers have numerous terrain options on both sides of Alpine Meadows ski area. The front side is home to long groomers and some excellent intermediate runs off Roundhouse and Hot Wheels chairlifts. Then, take Rays Rut around to the backside, where you&rsquo;ll access some of Alpine&rsquo;s best intermediate/advanced runs.</p>\r\n<h2>Palisades Tahoe Valley Tips</h2>\r\n<p>The first lifts to open are usually the Red Dog and KT-22 lifts. KT is the most coveted, and people line up at 6:30 a.m. to be the first to reach The Fingers, which encompasses amazing expert terrain when covered in deep snow, but sketchy once skied out. Nose to Fingers is considered one of the best lines on the mountain. Access Nose by skiing looker&rsquo;s right of the KT-22 lift towers. The Fingers are a band of rocks about midway down the mountain.</p>\r\n<p>To avoid the charge up KT-22, take the Red Dog lift instead. Its terrain is less skied but equally as challenging without the crowds. Poulson\'s Gully, to skiers right of the lift towers, and Heidi&rsquo;s Rock are favorite steep and deep runs from Red Dog. Heidi&rsquo;s Rock requires a short hike and is reached by disembarking toward Red Dog Ridge. If the snow falls all day, head back to KT, which provides so much expert terrain that it hardly matters where you go because there are so many premier lines.</p>\r\n<p>The Funitel (don&rsquo;t call it a gondola!) will typically open next. Ride it to High Camp and ski down to the Siberia Express lift, which whisks you to the ridgeline and the top of Siberia Bowl. On big snow days, the lifts typically open from looker&rsquo;s left to right, with Granite Chief often last to open. Granite Chief is located on the far boundary to looker&rsquo;s right, providing a bevy of unnamed runs and expert terrain where the crowds are often minimal&mdash;perfect for an afternoon expedition on a powder day.</p>\r\n<h2>Alpine Meadows Tips</h2>\r\n<p>The resort is home to some great terrain for the powder lover. When snow is in the forecast, head to the lifts early to make sure you get fresh tracks. Hop in line at the Summit Express, as this is one of the first lifts that will be open. Just off the top of Summit lift, the Ds are a great first choice powder run, named for an old D8 tractor that accidentally slid over the edge while trying to clear a road to the summit.</p>\r\n<p>The Ice Bar is a local&rsquo;s favorite situated at the base of the Sherwood Bowl. Here, you&rsquo;ll find quick bites and cold beers in a beach-like setting. Stay &lsquo;till happy hour on the Alpine Sun Deck, and catch some great live music in the spring.</p>\r\n<h2>Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h2>\r\n<p>The Nordic Center at the Resort at Palisades Tahoe offers approximately 11 miles of groomed trails that wind through the stunning Palisades Tahoe meadow and surrounding hillside. The trails are 70% beginner, 20% intermediate, and 10% advanced, and nordic equipment rentals are available.

  'description': '<p>Best Restaurants &amp; Bars at Heavenly Mountain</h2>\r\n<h3 > For Breakfast</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Red Hut</strong> is a Tahoe breakfast institution with three locations, including the original shop that opened in 1959 and the more conveniently-located new caf&eacute; on the corner of Ski Run and Lake Tahoe boulevards. The omelets are great, but waffles, including bacon waffles with the crispy strips cooked right in, are the house favorite.&amp;</p>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch</h3>\r\n<p>Featuring a towering wall of windows, massive wooden beams, and a modern-mountain design, the <strong>Tamarack Lodge</strong> atop the Heavenly gondola is a model for energy efficiency and pleasing aesthetics. Choose from a selection of foods ranging from pizza to pasta to everything in between, with indoor and outdoor seating.</p>\r\n<p>Named for the legendary youth ski team that produced Glen Plake and other past skiing greats, <strong>Blue Angel Caf&eacute;</strong>&nbsp;is a short drive from the California base and is a favorite local spot due to its innovative menu and affordable prices. Try the curry of the day or the daily True Blue Plate Special, and don&rsquo;t skip the sweet potato fries with homemade aioli.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Dinner</h3>\r\n<p><strong>19 Kitchen Bar</strong> on the 19th floor of Harvey&rsquo;s casino offers some of the best views of the lake, a VIP seating area, hardwood grill and a small but select menu of American seafood and steak specialties. Start with a Tahoe-tini, order the Chilean sea bass or filet mignon, and don&rsquo;t forget the homemade donuts for dessert.</p>\r\n<p>With a spacious and modern d&eacute;cor, the <strong>Edgewood Tahoe Restaurant</strong> provides unimpeded views of Lake Tahoe from every table and is located at the south shore&rsquo;s finest golf course. House favorites include the seared elk steak with sun-dried cherry relish and spaetzle or the marinated bavette steak.</p>\r\n<p>Located near the marina and several art galleries for after-dinner browsing, <strong>Riva Grill</strong> is a local&rsquo;s favorite with d&eacute;cor inspired by Tahoe&rsquo;s summertime wooden boating culture. Cocktails include the famous Wet Woody, and the menu features upscale burgers and fish tacos as well as the signature chimichurri pork tenderloin.</p>\r\n<p>With gourmet pizzas, salads and pasta dishes, <strong>Blue Dog Pizza</strong> is a short walk from Gondola Square in the Raley&rsquo;s shopping plaza, across the street from Heavenly Village.</p>\r\n<h3 > Apr&egrave;s &amp; Nightlife</h3>\r\n<p>Known as a 24-hour party town due to its casino nightclubs, blackjack tables, and drink specials, South Lake Tahoe offers loads of opportunity for naughty nights.</p>\r\n<p><strong>McP&rsquo;s Pub</strong> is a local&rsquo;s hangout with a covered and heated outdoor deck and a wide selection of beers.</p>\r\n<p>Located in Heavenly Village near the skating rink, <strong>Fire + Ice</strong> serves classic and fruity martinis and has an outdoor patio with fire pits for enjoying the sunset.</p>\r\n<p>Late-nighters and bridesmaids on a bender should head to <strong>Opal</strong> in the MontBleu casino, where the music thumps until morning and scantily-clad dancers shimmy on mini-stages beneath flashing lights.</p>'},
 {'tab': 'mountain_overview',
  'description': '<p>Heavenly Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p>First time to Heavenly? These are our suggestions for the best terrain options for every type of skier.</p>\r\n<p>First, lap the Powder Bowl Express lift, hitting the bumps of Waterfall run. Then, take Sky Chair to the summit and swoosh down the fast groomers of Ellie&rsquo;s and High Five. Now, it&rsquo;s time for a short hike. Traverse Sky Line trail (due to its width, Heavenly requires some traversing to get from California to Nevada and back) to the bottom of Milky Way Bowl. Unclick just past the sign on Sky Line Trail, and follow the boot pack up to the summit of Monument Peak, which at 10,067 feet is Tahoe&rsquo;s highest in-bounds terrain. Drop straight down the middle of Milky Way Bowl, or work to skier&rsquo;s right toward Mott and Killebrew canyons.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to avoid the agro conditions in Mott and Killebrew, but need some off-piste fun, check out the tree runs and pillow drops through Nevada Woods and The Burn - where charred trees from a fire provide starkly beautiful views, and powder stashes await those willing to explore. Wrap up with a finishing run down The Face or a tree run through East Bowl Woods back to the California lodge.</p>\r\n<p>Located right out of the California base, The Face is a double-black mogul run unforgiving in its steepness. It drops 1,700 vertical feet into the equally challenging Gunbarrel and East Bowl moguls. These are the bump runs made famous by former hot-dogger Glen Plake, who holds the annual Gunbarrel 25 event here that challenges skiers to complete 25 thigh-burning laps.</p>\r\n<p>The Milky Way Bowl is the best place to find fresh powder for expert skiers. For amazing tree turns, head to the Pinnacles and take some time to dip into the pines. Intermediates should head to Ridge Run and check out the amazing views of Lake Tahoe.</p>\r\n<h3 > Heavenly Mountain Powder Day Strategy</h3>\r\n<p>There are two ways to attack the mountain on a powder day, and the choice really depends on Heavenly&rsquo;s weather and from which side (California or Nevada) you start your ski day. Mild temperatures at Lake Tahoe level can necessitate heading for the top, where snow is lighter. But, if temps are cold down low, then options are bountiful.</p>\r\n<p><strong>California Lodge Route</strong><br />Setting out from Heavenly Ski Resort&rsquo;s California Lodge, take Gunbarrel lift, and bag a quick lap through the well-spaced trees of East Bowl Woods. Ride Gunbarrel lift back up and board the mid-mountain Powder Bowl Express, disembarking to the right for Powder Bowl Woods - an often-overlooked tree stash at mid-mountain. When Powder Bowl Woods are skied out, ride Canyon Express to the top and descend beneath the lift to the trees of Ridge Bowl. Take Sky Express back up and drop down the fall line into the trees to skier&rsquo;s right of Liz&rsquo;s run.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Heavenly Village Route</strong><br />If starting from Heavenly Village, take the gondola to mid-mountain and board Tamarack Express, heading skier&rsquo;s right to access Airies Woods, which drop you out at Dipper Express lift. Ride Dipper to the terminus and ski toward Dipper Woods and Milky Way. By this time, patrol will hopefully have opened the gates to some of Heavenly&rsquo;s best terrain&mdash;Mott Canyon, where skilled skiers can find steep chutes and rock drops. While waiting for Mott to open, hit the Dipper Knob area to skier&rsquo;s right of Meteor trail. Adjacent to Mott is the equally ferocious Killebrew Canyon, typically the last terrain at Heavenly to open, so be prepared to pounce when it does.</p>\r\n<h3 > Groomers &amp; Family Skiing at Heavenly</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly has a large grooming fleet, which means an abundance of groomer options for beginners and intermediates.</p>\r\n<p>From the gondola terminus, take Tamarack Express and do a warm-up lap on California Trail or Sam&rsquo;s Dream. Go back up Tamarack and drop into Orion and the East Peak area, served by the Dipper and Comet chairlifts. Cruise the Comet trail and take the lift back up. This time, ski down Crossover to the Olympic Express lift, which offers a run through the wide-open glades of The Pines.</p>\r\n<p>If starting on the California side, head to the top of Liz&rsquo;s run off the Sky Express lift, making sure to look over your shoulder at Lake Tahoe. Take Sky back up and descend Ridge Run, which offers some of the mountain&rsquo;s most amazing lake views. Stop off to the side and grab a photo.</p>\r\n<h3 > Heavenly Mountain Resort for Beginners</h3>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a beginner and want to explore some higher terrain, go to the Enchanted Forest. With shorter runs and gentle slopes, it&rsquo;s a great place to start.</p>\r\n<p>Beginner skiers and riders can also head for Maggie&rsquo;s run, served by the Powder Bowl Express lift. Maggie&rsquo;s run meanders down to the &ldquo;Snow Beach&rdquo; area, where a small food shack offers hot chocolate and snacks, and beach chairs provide a relaxed setting for families to meet up while doing laps on different lifts.</p>\r\n<p>Newbies who want beginner trails only should stick to the Boulder Lodge area, a little-trafficked ski area within the resort that features a gentle, wide-open bowl for working on turns and skiing with the kids.</p>\r\n<h3 > Heavenly Terrain Park</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly Ski Resort also has multiple terrain parks designed to serve everyone from beginners to go-big huckers.</p>\r\n<p>For first-timers and rookies, the <strong>progression park</strong> near the gondola offers low boxes and rails that are almost flush with the snow to eliminate the fear factor.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Groove Park</strong> is the most popular, offering smaller features for beginners and intermediates, though experienced boarders and jibbers often start here with some warm-up runs or to practice moves. Groove is set up like a skate park, with a lot of features packed into a small area.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Player&rsquo;s Park</strong> (off Ridge Run) and Ante Up Park (beneath Tamarack Express) are classified as medium/intermediate terrain parks in terms of their features. Player&rsquo;s Park has a line of triple jumps and progressive jibs. Ante Up&rsquo;s claim to fame is a jib line featuring old water pipes and recycled scrap items that provide a unique vibe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>High Roller</strong> is where the fearless go to play, with expert-level hits and gaps that provide a show for people riding the Sky chair. High Roller terrain park has a 55-foot and a 65-foot jump as well as playful touches, such as tire stacks for clearing or tapping on the way by.</p>\r\n<h3 >Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p>Heavenly offers tubing&hellip; and mini tubing! Located at the top of the gondola, their tubing hill is over 500 feet long and has a convenient magic carpet to take you and your tube back up to the top. Shorter riders and young children can enjoy the mini-tubing hill adjacent to the main hill in Adventure Peak.</p>\r\n<h3 >Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>For beautiful views of Lake Tahoe, you&rsquo;ll want to head toward North of South Lake Tahoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Y&rdquo; intersection of Highway 50/89. On the lakeside, you&rsquo;ll find the mostly-flat and short trails at Pope, Kiva, and Baldwin Beaches. West of the &ldquo;Y,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll find a number of easy-to-moderate trails along Lake Tahoe Boulevard, Tahoe Mountain Road, and North Upper Truckee Road. From the Echo Lakes/Johnson Pass Sno-Park, you can ski through Desolation Wilderness to Echo Lakes and Lake Aloha for some of the most stunning landscapes in the area.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind, nearly all cross-country ski and snowshoe trails in South Lake Tahoe are on public lands, meaning they&rsquo;re not groomed. Fortunately, many people ski at most locations so there are usually established tracks.</p>'},

The payoff is extraordinary lake views as well as the feeling that you are high in the mountains and away from the run-of-the-mill, lower-mountain slopes that most ski resorts provide for newbies.</p>\r\n<p>Palisades Tahoe will never win any awards for its tree skiing - there simply isn&rsquo;t that much due to the mountain&rsquo;s vast open expanses - but those who seek a forested environment should head to the Palisades Tahoe and Red Dog lifts as well as the lower sections of Granite Chief.</p>\r\n<h3 > High Camp &amp; SnoVentures Activity Zone</h3>\r\n<p>High Camp is a mountaintop meadow tucked between high peaks where experts can get an adrenaline fix before meeting up with less skilled family members for lunch. High Camp has a swimming pool and skating rink as well as outdoor seating, providing an inspiring setting for all ability levels.</p>\r\n<p>For young children, the Papoose beginner&rsquo;s area is on the far eastern side of the parking lot beside the SnoVentures Activity Zone, where you will find mini snowmobiles for kids and snow tubing for all ages. This is the learning ground for first-timers, complete with free hot chocolate.</p>\r\n<h3 > Palisades Tahoe Route</h3>\r\n<p>For intermediates, Palisades Tahoe offers uncrowded runs and beautiful lake views, with groomers that loop down to the Resort at Palisades Tahoe on the far looker&rsquo;s left of the resort. Palisades Tahoe offers classic American skiing, with trails cut through the trees&mdash;something you don&rsquo;t get much of in the wide-open expanses of Palisades Tahoe.</p>\r\n<p>Skiers and riders can access upper-mountain intermediate terrain via the Shirley Lake Express, a fast, six-pack chairlift perfect for doing laps. The Gold Coast six-pack lift provides advanced intermediate runs. Round out the day with some laps on the Solitude lift, which drops down from High Camp into groomed and ungroomed intermediate runs, glades and tree islands.</p>\r\n<h3 > Granite Peak Trail</h3>\r\n<p>For skiers who like to hike, Palisades Tahoe has bountiful options. Granite Peak, accessed via Granite Chief, is the ski resort&rsquo;s highest point at just over 9,000 feet, so it loads well on powder days and offers lots of secret stashes days after a storm. Hidden Bowl features steep wide-open terrain and tree shots, making this area prime for exploration.</p>\r\n<h3 > Palisade Chutes</h3>\r\n<p>The Palisades chutes are some of the most infamous &ldquo;Squallywood&rdquo; terrain, featured in countless ski films. If you go big here, lots of chairlift riders will be watching and cheering. Access Palisades expert terrain via the Siberia Express, but be prepared to handle a cornice drop. Lesser-seasoned skiers should stick to the easiest of the Palisades chutes, National Chute to looker&rsquo;s left. Named for Olympian Jonny Mosely, Mosley\'s Run is a severely steep bump run that Jonny credits with giving him the skills to handle the world&rsquo;s toughest moguls competitions.</p>\r\n<h3 > Palisades Tahoe Beginner Trails</h3>\r\n<p>Big Blue is pure bliss for true beginners or for those who need to warm up before hitting it big. The terrain is easy to access using the Aerial Tram up to High Camp. From there, visitors can access the gently sloped terrain of Bailey&rsquo;s Beach and Gold Coast. The Big Blue area even offers the Belmont terrain park designed to introduce beginner and intermediate skiers to park ski and riding.</p>\r\n<h2>Alpine Meadows Ski Area</h2>\r\n<p>The terrain on the Alpine Meadows side of the ski resort consists of wide-open bowls, long groomed slopes and abundant natural features within its 2,400 skiable acres. The ski area&rsquo;s front and backsides boast plenty of beginner, intermediate, and advanced options.</p>\r\n<h3 > Pacific Crest North Bowls</h3>\r\n<p>Alpine Meadows offers some of the best skiing and riding in Lake Tahoe with the Pacific Crest Bowls, offering backcountry access to expert skiers with the proper equipment. Take the short (or long) hike or traverse out to one of these bowls, and then end up back at a high-speed chairlift. From the summit of Ward Peak, visitors can take in spectacular views of the surrounding mountains and Lake Tahoe.</p>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Meadows Beginner and Intermediate Ski Trails</h3>\r\n<p>Beginner and intermediate skiers have numerous terrain options on both sides of Alpine Meadows ski area. The front side is home to long groomers and some excellent intermediate runs off Roundhouse and Hot Wheels chairlifts. Then, take Rays Rut around to the backside, where you&rsquo;ll access some of Alpine&rsquo;s best intermediate/advanced runs.</p>\r\n<h2>Palisades Tahoe Valley Tips</h2>\r\n<p>The first lifts to open are usually the Red Dog and KT-22 lifts. KT is the most coveted, and people line up at 6:30 a.m. to be the first to reach The Fingers, which encompasses amazing expert terrain when covered in deep snow, but sketchy once skied out. Nose to Fingers is considered one of the best lines on the mountain. Access Nose by skiing looker&rsquo;s right of the KT-22 lift towers. The Fingers are a band of rocks about midway down the mountain.</p>\r\n<p>To avoid the charge up KT-22, take the Red Dog lift instead. Its terrain is less skied but equally as challenging without the crowds. Poulson\'s Gully, to skiers right of the lift towers, and Heidi&rsquo;s Rock are favorite steep and deep runs from Red Dog. Heidi&rsquo;s Rock requires a short hike and is reached by disembarking toward Red Dog Ridge. If the snow falls all day, head back to KT, which provides so much expert terrain that it hardly matters where you go because there are so many premier lines.</p>\r\n<p>The Funitel (don&rsquo;t call it a gondola!) will typically open next. Ride it to High Camp and ski down to the Siberia Express lift, which whisks you to the ridgeline and the top of Siberia Bowl. On big snow days, the lifts typically open from looker&rsquo;s left to right, with Granite Chief often last to open. Granite Chief is located on the far boundary to looker&rsquo;s right, providing a bevy of unnamed runs and expert terrain where the crowds are often minimal&mdash;perfect for an afternoon expedition on a powder day.</p>\r\n<h2>Alpine Meadows Tips</h2>\r\n<p>The resort is home to some great terrain for the powder lover. When snow is in the forecast, head to the lifts early to make sure you get fresh tracks. Hop in line at the Summit Express, as this is one of the first lifts that will be open. Just off the top of Summit lift, the Ds are a great first choice powder run, named for an old D8 tractor that accidentally slid over the edge while trying to clear a road to the summit.</p>\r\n<p>The Ice Bar is a local&rsquo;s favorite situated at the base of the Sherwood Bowl. Here, you&rsquo;ll find quick bites and cold beers in a beach-like setting. Stay &lsquo;till happy hour on the Alpine Sun Deck, and catch some great live music in the spring.</p>\r\n<h2>Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h2>\r\n<p>The Nordic Center at the Resort at Palisades Tahoe offers approximately 11 miles of groomed trails that wind through the stunning Palisades Tahoe meadow and surrounding hillside. The trails are 70% beginner, 20% intermediate, and 10% advanced, and nordic equipment rentals are available. All trails originate at the Resort at Palisades Tahoe, just a short (free) shuttle ride from the Palisades Tahoe Parking Lot.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Aspen Mountain Terrain</h2>\r\n<h3>Ski the Mountain&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p class="p1">Aspen Mountain has been offering black diamond skiing directly above the town of Aspen since 1947. Though somewhat small in size, Aspen Mountain offers every kind of terrain in a compact, accessible package. The knowledgeable skier can maximize vertical by linking together fall line runs all over the mountain. From steeps to bumps to trees, Aspen Mountain is a terrain smorgasbord, accessed by a state-of-the-art gondola (iTunes docks included) and eight lifts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1">The total elevation is 11,212 feet with a base elevation of 7,945 feet and a total vertical drop of 3,267 feet. The breakout is 0% beginner, 48% intermediate, 26% advanced and 26% expert. The longest run is 3 miles. There is a total of 673 skiable acres and 300 inches of snow bolstered by snowmaking on 31% of the area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers and Family</h3>\r\n<p>Aspen Mountain boasts 76 runs. The steepest one, Silver Queen, sits at an angle of 42 degrees. Aspen Mountain isn&rsquo;t ideal for beginners, but it&rsquo;s possible to ski the upper mountain while avoiding Spar Gulch and Copper Bowl, the two main top-to-botton funnel runs, which tend to intimidate families and beginner skiers. Ski off Chairs Seven, Three or Six to find some intermediate terrain at the top of the mountain. Don&rsquo;t miss Ruthie&rsquo;s Run, quite possibly the most consistent, fall line groomer in Colorado. The entire family will enjoy Bonnie&rsquo;s, a midmountain restaurant serving legendary white bean chili and apple strudel with homemade whipped cream. Its famous two-tiered outdoor deck is a favorite hangout spot.</p>\r\n<h2>Snowmass Terrain</h2>\r\n<h3>Ski the Mountain&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Snowmass is actually the larger of the four mountains with a base elevation of 8,104 feet and a top elevation of 12,510 feet for a total of 4,406 feet of vertical. It also features 3,132 skiable acres serviced by 21 lifts. Unlike Aspen Mountain, there is some dedicated beginner terrain, breaking out 6% beginner, 50% intermediate and 44% expert. Like Aspen Mountain, it also receives 300 inches of snowfall each year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Snowmass has a total of 94 runs with 3 terrain parks, including a Superpipe and a minipipe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers and Family</h3>\r\n<p>Snowmass is known for its family-friendly activities as well wide-open, groomed areas. It is consistently rated a top skiing destination for families. If you don\'t want to ski the whole time, the entire family can enjoy the Breathtaker Alpine Coaster and the Ullr Nights.&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': "<h3>Terrain</h3>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek Resort offers terrain for all ability levels. Arrowhead Village and Bachelor Gulch have great beginner and intermediate terrain. Centennial is a perfect cruiser, steep enough for advanced skiers to let it out at speed, but wide enough for intermediates to make lots of turns. There are 19 beginner, 43 intermediate and 38 advanced runs. The longest run is 2.75 miles, and there are three terrain parks.</p>\r\n<p>The trees between most runs at Beaver Creek are tight, so make sure your skills are advanced enough before steering off a run. Midseason when the snow is good, intermediates can try Coyote Glade.</p>\r\n<p>If chutes are your game, the Upper and Lower Stone Creek Chutes are steep and narrow, and the snow is often deep. Cliff bands mixed with glades give skiers shots from 400 to 600 vertical feet, with pitches up to 45 degrees.</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers &amp; Family</h3>\r\n<p>Latigo and Gold Dust on Beaver Creek Mountain are long, easy intermediate trails, wide enough to make big turns. The entrances to Red Tail and Upper Harrier aren't obvious, so many skiers pass by, leaving these intermediate trails less tracked. The biggest spread of beginner and easy intermediate trails surround the Bachelor Gulch Express and Arrow Bahn Express lifts that are a cat-track away from the main mountain. If you're lodging in Bachelor Gulch or Arrowhead Village, just look uphill. Some beginner trails here curve through wooded areas, so skiers and riders get a sense of what it's like to ski through the trees.</p>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek is one of the rare mountains where novices and intermediates alike head straight to the mountaintop for 360-degree views while skiing on a network of green and blue trails. Halfway down some of the green runs off the Cinch Express lift, skiers exiting off lifts from more advanced trails spill onto the runs. From the top, go skier's right to Red Buffalo, Booth Gardens and the other trails for a more isolated beginner's playground.</p>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek is also very kid-friendly with kids&rsquo; adventure zones placed around the mountain.</p>"},

  'description': "<p>Beaver Creek has far fewer skiers than its neighbors to the east, so it's easier to find powder even late in the day. Grab a grooming report before taking the first chairlift ride so you'll know where the powder&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p>Many days only half of Larkspur Bowl is groomed, and the rest is pure powder. If the Centennial Trail is un-groomed, catch one of the first chairlifts up and then turn around and head right back down for an extended powder skiing romp.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When it snows all day, you'll even find advanced skiers floating through powder on the green runs off the Cinch Express at the very top of Beaver Creek. The high-speed quad in Rose Bowl promises powder much of the day, too. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On big dump days, the runs under the Birds of Prey chairlift are tempting, but be aware that the fluffy-looking surface usually hides big moguls. Experts race to Grouse Mountain early for freshies on Royal Elk Glade and Black Bear, both double-black diamonds.</p>"}],

  'description': '<p>Breckenridge Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p>Breck is situated in the Rockies and is nestled along the Tenmile Range&mdash;making it an ideal location for skiers and riders of all skill levels. The mountain features four base areas that make up its 2,908 acres of skiable terrain including smooth groomers, a 22-foot halfpipe, and some standout steeps.</p>\r\n<p>On a bluebird powder day, skiers and riders should head up to Horseshoe Bowl, North Bowl and Whale&rsquo;s Tail on the Imperial Express SuperChair&mdash;the highest chairlift in North America. You can also access this area via the T-Bar on Peak 7. Here you will find wide-open, double black diamond skiing. If steeps are your thing, head left from the top of the Imperial chair and work Easy Street and the rest of the Lake Chutes.</p>\r\n<p>Because this portion of the ski area is above treeline, visibility can be compromised during snowstorms. If that\'s the case, Breck&rsquo;s tree runs off the back of Peak 9 and E-Chair are a good alternative. For the experienced and fit, there is excellent hike-to, inbound terrain off the top of E-Chair. Once the bowls get tracked out, head over to the Falcon Chair and ski The Burn or the countless black diamond runs that Peak 10 has to offer.</p>\r\n<h3 > Breckenridge Terrain</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 6</strong></p>\r\n<p>They don&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;Serenity Bowl&rdquo; for nothing. From the top of the super chair, hike about 10 minutes to the 12,573-foot Peak 6 summit, head skier&rsquo;s right, and drop in. With boot-deep powder and a wide-open bowl, it feels like backcountry&mdash;but with regular ski patrol avalanche control, it&rsquo;s safer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 7</strong></p>\r\n<p>Serviced by the Independence SuperChair, Peak 7 is packed full of blue cruiser runs which are ideal for intermediate skiers and riders. Skirt the northernmost boundary of the resort on Monte Cristo or rip fast laps on Pioneer. Whether you want to be mellow or work on your GS turns, this is the place for you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 8</strong></p>\r\n<p>What isn&rsquo;t there to love about Peak 8? First, there&rsquo;s the Imperial Express, the highest elevation chairlift in North America (which delivers you to some of the resort&rsquo;s best terrain, by the way). Then there&rsquo;s the T-Bar, a buzzing watering hole with an extensive beer, wine, and cocktail choices. There&rsquo;s also the outdoor stage that comes out in the spring and hosts live music and, finally, there&rsquo;s Freeway, where you might catch Shaun White practicing on the four massive jumps, myriad rails, and boxes or the 22-foot Superpipe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 9</strong></p>\r\n<p>Chances are, you&rsquo;re no Olympian, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t push your own limits. This season you can race on the EpicMix racecourse. Race yourself, your friends, or even four-time overall World Cup Champion and Olympic Gold Medalist, Lindsey Vonn. Find the EpicMix Race Course on Peak 9: from the Beaver Run Superchair, ride Sundown to the race location.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 10</strong></p>\r\n<p>Challenge yourself on some of Breck&rsquo;s toughest terrain and get there fast on the speedy Falcon SuperChair. Known as a &ldquo;Bi&rdquo; or Bicentennial Peak, it&rsquo;s on the top 200 highest in the state of Colorado and offers spectacular views of the Tenmile Range.</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p>Breckenridge doesn&rsquo;t have its own tubing park, but you can visit the Frisco Adventure Park just 20 minutes from Breckenridge. It features a multi-lane tubing hill and beginner ski &amp; ride hill, both serviced by an easy-to-use surface lift. The Adventure Park also includes the Frisco Nordic Center, which offers 27 kilometers of ski trails, 20 kilometers of snowshoe trails, rentals, skate or classic lessons, and ski tuning seven days a week.</p>\r\n<p>Carter Park, Breck&rsquo;s sledding hill, is located at the south end of High Street adjacent to the Breckenridge Elementary School. It&rsquo;s free--just bring your own sled and some hot cocoa!</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>The Breckenridge Nordic Center is located just a minute&rsquo;s drive from downtown Breckenridge and 90 minutes from Denver. It has 2,000 acres of groomed cross-country skiing and snowshoe trails. After your day out on the trails, enjoy food and drink specials and beautiful views from their handcrafted log lodge.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Things to Do in Breckenridge</h2>\r\n<h3 > Breckenridge Essentials</h3>\r\n<p>As one of the most popular resorts in Colorado, Breck can get crowded very fast, especially on a powder day. Avoid a long line on T-bar or Imperial on Peak 8 by hitting runs like Little Johnny&rsquo;s, which still offers plenty of powder under the Rocky Mountain Super Chair while you wait for a break in the T-bar queue.</p>\r\n<p>Escape the crowds and go where the locals go, Motherload Tavern. This family-friendly establishment offers a relaxing atmosphere, chill back patio and home-cooked meals. Kick back, enjoy a game of corn hole and unwind after an epic day on the mountain.</p>\r\n<h3 > Non-skiing Activities</h3>\r\n<p>Need a break from the skis? Top winter activities in Breckenridge include dog sledding, snowmobiling, fat biking, sleigh rides, scenic cat tours, historic tours, and mine tours.</p>\r\n<h3 > Top Winter Events in Breckenridge</h3>\r\n<p>Breck offers a calendar full of competitions, concerts, celebrations, parades and week-long special events.

You\'ll learn basic backcountry skills and where to find the freshest powder. Breck Guides is available for Levels 8+ skiers and snowboarders only.</p>\r\n<h3 > Child Care</h3>\r\n<p>Breck&rsquo;s Child Care Centers offer a fun environment where your child can play during your stay.

  'description': '<h3>Terrain</h3>\r\n<p>Crested Butte is best known for its diverse extreme terrain with the upper parts of the mountain containing steep and rocky chutes, tree glades, bowls and cliff drops. Some of North America&rsquo;s most advanced inbounds terrain is located at Crested Butte, and the resort is home to various freeskiing championships.</p>\r\n<p>There is a total of 1,547 skiable acres serviced by 15 lifts, with 300 inches of snow per year and snowmaking on 297 acres. Lift-served vertical drop is 2,775 feet; overall is 3,026 feet. With 121 trails, the trail descriptions are 27% beginner, 57% intermediate and 16% advanced. The longest run is 2.6 miles long. The summit elevation is 12,162 feet, and base elevation is 9,375 feet. The lowest lift is at 9,100 feet.</p>\r\n<p>Freestylers can take advantage of the five terrain parks: Cascade Park, the expert park with hybrid rail combinations and technical jibs; Ten Peaks Progression Park, designed for beginner and intermediates; Keystone Job Park, which includes Crested Butte&rsquo;s most popular boxes and rails features; and Lower Twister Terrain Park, which is the newest with rolling terrain. The Gold Link Family Cross Course is a family-friendly skier and boarder cross track.</p>\r\n<p>The resort is a great place to get those untouched powder lines because of the lack of crowds and short lift lines. Crested Butte has adequate terrain for beginners and a dedicated first-timers area. As for the intermediates, skiers and riders should explore some of the blue runs off the East River Lift. The expert terrain requires significant snow cover and is great when base amounts are deep.</p>'},

Miners who couldn&rsquo;t afford the toll were stationed at area called Purgatory Flats because they were stuck in limbo between heading to Silverton or turning around and heading home.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Activities at Purgatory Resort</h3>\r\n<p>During the summer, the mountain turns into a biker&rsquo;s paradise with miles of cross country and downhill riding access from uphill trails or lifts.

  'description': "<p>Steamboat Ski Resort is a premier ski destination famous for its Champagne Powder&reg;. The mountain is also known for its unique aspen glades, offering up some of the best tree skiing in North America.</p>\r\n<p>Founded in 1963, Steamboat Ski Resort is situated across seven mountain peaks within the Park Range and overlooks the Yampa Valley. The area has a rich western heritage and cowboy vibe that's celebrated throughout many annual events held on the mountain and in town, including the Cowboy Downhill and the Steamboat Winter Carnival.</p>\r\n<p>One of the largest ski resorts in Colorado, Steamboat Springs has been dubbed Ski Town, U.S.A. &reg;, due to the fact that more Olympians call Steamboat home than any other ski resort. It&rsquo;s one of Colorado's best family-friendly ski resorts.</p>\r\n<p>Steamboat Ski Resort has over 4.6 square miles (2,965 acres) of skiable terrain, 169 named trails, and 18 lifts. The base elevation is 6,900 feet, and the summit elevation is 10,568 feet. The vertical rise is 3,668 feet.</p>\r\n<p>The resort is located just outside of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. It&rsquo;s about a 3-hour drive from Denver and an hour and a half from Summit County.</p>"},

  'description': '<p class="p1"><strong>Airports</strong></p>\r\n<p class="p1">The closest airport to Steamboat is Yampa Valley Regional Airport (HDN), 20 miles west of the resort. United is the only year-round major carrier, but during winter months carriers include American (from Dallas/Ft. Worth and Chicago), Delta (from Minneapolis and Atlanta), Frontier (from Denver), and Continental (from Houston). If you&rsquo;re on a budget first look at flying into Denver (DEN) approximately three hours to the southwest and renting a car or booking a Go Alpine shuttle (see below).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1"><strong>From The Airport</strong></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Check first with your lodging provider to see if airport shuttles are included with your stay. If they aren&rsquo;t &mdash;and that will be the case if you&rsquo;re flying into Denver International&mdash;plan on renting a car or booking a shuttle through <a href="http://goalpine.com" target="_blank"><strong>Go Alpine</strong></a> (800-343-RIDE), which offers transportation from both airports. Shared service and private airport limo service from HDN can also be arranged with <a href="http://stormmountainexpress.com" target="_blank"><strong>Storm Mountain Express</strong></a> (877-844-8787). Just don&rsquo;t expect any public transportation, it doesn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1"><strong>Getting Around Once You&rsquo;re There</strong></p>\r\n<p class="p1">You don&rsquo;t strictly need a car. Steamboat&rsquo;s base area is pedestrian-friendly, and so is downtown Steamboat Springs (located four miles from the resort), but getting between the two requires wheels. As you consider lodging options, check their shuttle service: Some (but not all) provide rides to the lifts or to town. No shuttle? Ask about bus-stop proximity. Steamboat Springs operates a free bus system linking the base area to the town and area condos.&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Best Restaurants &amp; Bars in Steamboat</h2>\r\n<h3 > For Breakfast</h3>\r\n<p>Situated at the edge of town, <strong>Creekside Caf&eacute;</strong> serves up sizable breakfast and lunch dishes, including unique and specialty creations like the Wafflelaughagus. The Bloody Mary at this quaint caf&eacute; is equally sizable and a standout.</p>\r\n<p>Located between downtown and the resort, <strong>Freshies&nbsp;</strong>crams rainbow-hued veggies and top-quality cheeses (like aged white cheddar) into Steamboat&rsquo;s best omelets. The sweets are fantastic, too. Try the famous cinnamon rolls or a plate of dried cherry granola pancakes. Colorful pendant lamps and exotic fresh flowers (never carnations!) complement the colorful food.</p>\r\n<p>Right there on the main strip, smack in the middle of town, <strong>Winona\'s Restaurant &amp; Bakery</strong> serves up world-famous homemade cinnamon rolls that will spoil your appetite. Share it with at least one or two others, and then settle in for a huge selection of breakfast and lunch options.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch</h3>\r\n<p>Glide into <strong>Hazie&rsquo;s&nbsp;</strong>for top-of-the-gondola panoramas over the Yampa Valley. Reserve a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows to admire the distant Flat Tops while you enjoy a delicious meal. Hazie&rsquo;s bar, a brass-and-mahogany affair, also turns out a respectable Bloody Mary.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Dinner</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Caf<strong>&eacute;</strong> Diva</strong> is the base area&rsquo;s most romantic restaurant, with tables tucked into tiny alcoves and expert wait staff that make diners feel special. The restaurant specializes in locally sourced meats and produce.</p>\r\n<p>For a low-key spot that&rsquo;s still high bar about its food, try <strong>Mazzola&rsquo;s Italian Diner</strong>. This downtown pizza-and-pasta joint feels like a spiffy basement speakeasy, and its chummy servers welcome you as a member of the club.</p>\r\n<h3 > Apres &amp; Nightlife</h3>\r\n<p>Bar service is notoriously slow at <strong>Slopeside Grill</strong>, a ski-in, stagger-out bar located adjacent to the Christie III lift - but nobody cares. On sunny afternoons, this slope side joint resembles Daytona Beach as hordes of revelers strip down and belly up to the open-air ice bar.</p>\r\n<p>The upscale <strong>Truffle Pig Restaurant</strong> offers a great happy hour with seriously cheap beer and well drinks along with some munchies to tide you over for dinner.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Steamboat Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p>Unlike some ski areas, where the <strong>best beginner and intermediate terrain</strong> is located near the base, Steamboat&rsquo;s friendliest groomers are at the very top. Nicknamed &ldquo;Wally World,&rdquo; the blue runs served by the Sunshine Express Lift are mellow and wide. The trees bordering these runs are similarly forgiving and allow bolder members of the family to weave among the pines while more timid skiers stick to the open run - all the while staying within yards of one another. Plus, Wally World is first to catch the sun&rsquo;s rays, a plus on nippy mornings. On the lower mountain, be sure to hit Swinger: This green slope runs parallel to the always-jammed Right-O-Way and sees so little traffic that it offers uncut corduroy late into the afternoon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Steamboat&rsquo;s signature runs</strong> are Closets and Shadows, two sublimely long tree shots that are deservedly famous: When the pow is deep and soft, there&rsquo;s no finer tree skiing anywhere in North America. The catch? Everybody heads here for that postcard-perfect experience, so solitude is elusive, and the goods get gobbled fast. For a shorter (but less trafficked) version of Steamboat&rsquo;s celebrated tree-skiing, try Hot Cakes in Morningside Park.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For bumps</strong>, ride the Burgess Creek Lift, which accesses Norther (a blue-black that&rsquo;s mellow enough to let most skiers take the zipper-line) as well as White Out (Steamboat&rsquo;s best bump run). Or, ride the Four Points Lift and hammer Nelson&rsquo;s Run. Named for Olympic bronze medalist Nelson Carmichael (one of 84 Olympians that hail from Steamboat Springs, more than any other town in the U.S.), Nelson&rsquo;s big moguls and multiple fall lines demand expert mettle.</p>\r\n<p>If your guilty pleasure is rocketing down <strong>groomers</strong>, start your day on Heavenly Daze or Vagabond. By afternoon, these big boulevards become thoroughfares for barn-bound skiers, but in the morning, these intermediate runs make for gleeful first flights.</p>\r\n<h3 > Game Plan for a Powder Day at Steamboat</h3>\r\n<p>Get to the gondola at least 45 minutes before it opens. Riding the Silver Bullet is still the best and fastest way to the goods, and diehard powder-hounds take pride in &ldquo;pressing glass&rdquo; (being the first in line at the sliding glass doors of the gondola loading dock). Exiting the gondola, most traffic heads for the Storm Peak Express lift, which accesses the summit - but that doesn&rsquo;t open until 9 a.m. Don&rsquo;t wait there: instead, ride the Pony Express Lift. Snowstorms out of the south deposit heaps of powder on the stashes off Pioneer Ridge, which offer some of the mountain&rsquo;s longest runs. Plus, the masses don&rsquo;t usually head this way until after 10:30 a.m.</p>\r\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve plundered the easy pickings, take Storm Peak lift to ski Morningside Bowl, and ride Morningside Lift, which accesses the hike-to terrain off the top of Mt. Werner. These four gated access points offer up the resort&rsquo;s deepest snow. The choicest terrain sits beyond Gate C (North St. Pat&rsquo;s), which mixes wide, tree-lined alleys with narrow chutes and cliffy, mandatory-air lines. If the snowfall (and your muscles) stick around through the afternoon, hit the trees on skier&rsquo;s left of Storm Peak Face: these stashes often get neglected after the early-morning stampede.</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p>For kids (and kids at heart), don&rsquo;t miss Saddleback Ranch\'s Yee-Haw Tubing Hill. The hill is groomed and equipped with a state of the art tube-tow lift system that attaches itself to the tube to transport you back to the top. From there, speed down the hill on a large inner tube provided by the ranch. At the bottom, warm up in the Longhorn Warming Lodge, grab a bite to eat or a warm drink from the concession stand and hit the slope again.</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>The Haymaker Nordic Center has 8km of groomed trails for classic skiing, skate skiing and snowshoeing, all ability levels welcome.</p>\r\n<p>The Steamboat Ski Touring Center offers 15 km of trails groomed for classic and skate skiing for novice to advanced skiers, plus 10 km of snowshoe trails. The trails wind across meadows, into Aspen groves, and along Fish Creek, offering some of the most enjoyable and accessible winter recreation in the Yampa Valley. Hearty homemade lunches and snacks are available all day at The Picnic Basket in the Nordic Clubhouse.</p>\r\n<p>You can also explore the Yampa Valley\'s singletrack by fat bike.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Things to Do in Steamboat</h2>\r\n<h3 > Steamboat Essentials</h3>\r\n<p>Relax at Strawberry Park &amp; Old Town hot springs.</p>\r\n<p>Do the easy hike to Fish Creek Falls.</p>\r\n<p>Visit Howelsen Hill, Colorado&rsquo;s oldest continuously operated ski area since 1915. Featuring the largest and most complete natural ski jumping complex in North America, Howelsen has been the training ground for more than 89 Olympians making over 151 appearances in the Winter Olympics.</p>\r\n<h3 > Non-skiing Activities</h3>\r\n<p>Visit the Olympic-sized Howelsen Hill Ice Arena, which offers public skating in addition to bumper cars&hellip; on ice! Schedule a sleigh ride around the Yampa Valley&rsquo;s rolling hills or a Western Style BBQ Buffet at the top of the Steamboat Gondola for the family.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, don&rsquo;t miss the new Outlaw Mountain Coaster.

Fine-tune your racing skills, hit the slopes with Steamboat Olympians, or work on your carving in a 3-day women\'s clinic taught by Steamboat&rsquo;s top-level coaches.</p>\r\n<p>Kids can also spend the day at The Kids\' Vacation Center, which offers all-day group lessons for children ages 2 years 6 months to Kindergarten. Children are grouped by age and development and spend their time doing fun engaging activities inside and outside.</p>\r\n<h3 > Child Care</h3>\r\n<p>Steamboat Resort offers child care for children 1 to 6 years old. Professionals provide excellent care with age-appropriate activities and lots of fun while you enjoy the slopes.</p>'}],

  'description': '<p>Vail Ski Resort is world-renowned for providing guests with an experience that truly is &ldquo;Like nothing on Earth.&rdquo; Founded in 1962, the Colorado resort is home to seven legendary back bowls spanning seven miles across the backside of the resort. The ski area is enormous with over 5,289 acres to explore and four distinct base areas connected by free buses and heated walkways. It draws skiers from all over the world and provides excellent terrain for all ability levels.</span></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><span></span>The resort has great terrain options, excellent ski schools and a large assortment of shopping and dining options. The two main base areas are Vail Village and Lionshead. Vail Village located at the base of Gondola One is the original base area and is home to Vail&rsquo;s iconic covered bridge that crosses Gore Creek. Lionshead Village, located just west of Vail Village, is serviced by its own gondola and is home to luxury resorts.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Denver to Vail is about 1.5 hours &ndash; or more depending on traffic. It is 100 miles from Denver International Airport and 30 miles east of Eagle County Regional Airport (EGE). There are plenty of shuttle services to Vail. Once you get to Vail, you can navigate the town by bus for free.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Vail is a great destination for many skiers, but the resort can get crowded on the weekends. So, check the chair lift status signs at strategic intersections on the mountain to avoid backups. A yellow light means the lift maze is full so choose an alternative route if possible. A green light means you are good to go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Vail Ski Resort History</h2>\r\n<p>While many other ski resorts in the western United States started as mining towns, Vail was built from the ground up to be a ski resort. During World War II the U.S. Army established a training center at Camp Hale located just 14 miles south of what would later become Vail Mountain. The U.S. Army&rsquo;s 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Mountain Division trained at Camp Hale and consisted of excellent skiers and mountaineers that fought in the mountains of northern Italy during WWII. Upon their return from the war, they quickly became major players in the burgeoning ski industry.</p>\r\n<p>A veteran of the 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Mountain Division, Pete Seibert returned to Colorado after the war to search for a perfect location to build a ski area in the Rocky Mountain region. Pete teamed up with friend Earl Eaton who led Pete on a seven-hour climb up a no-name mountain, where they crested the summit to discover the now legendary back bowls.</p>'},

Boasting 5,289 acres of skiable terrain, 7 back bowls (3,017 acres) and Blue Sky Basin (645 acres), Vail mountain offers something for every ability level. The front side (1,627 acres) of the mountain is ideal for beginner and intermediate skiers looking to cruise perfect corduroy while more advanced skiers can head to the Back Bowls and Blue Sky Basin for a backcountry ski experience inbounds. The total number of runs is 195.</span></p>\r\n<p>On a powder day, there is no better place in the world than Vail&rsquo;s Back Bowls. Chair 5, also known as High Noon Express, which services Sun Up and Sun Down Bowls is a great place to start. Take a pristine run down a classic like Forever or Ricky&rsquo;s Ridge before working your way east. From the top of Chair 5, take a run in the Sun Up Bowl, and head up Chair 17 (Sun Up Lift), which will put you in a position to ski into Teacup Bowl.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The base elevation is 8,120 feet, mid-elevation 10,250 feet, and peak elevation 11,570 feet, with 3,450 feet of vertical rise.

For first-timers, Eagle&rsquo;s Nest is the place to be. Easily accessible from the top of the Eagle Bahn Gondola, a practice area with magic carpets and a non-intimidating beginner lift make this the perfect setting to find your ski or snowboard legs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">For the young, and the young at heart, Kids Adventure Zones are scattered across the mountain, teeming with opportunities to discover.

From chicken biscuits to pancakes to breakfast sandwiches, you&rsquo;re bound to find something hearty and delicious to eat.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Since 1982, <strong>Carver&rsquo;s Bakery Cafe</strong> has been providing Winter Park visitors and residents with fresh-baked goodies and drip coffee and espresso drinks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch and Dinner</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The best dining at the resort (base of the mountain) is hands down&nbsp;<strong>Rippy\'s Mountain Tavern.&nbsp;</strong>Big burgers, steaks, wings and sandwiches with fresh sides, it\'s everything you\'d want from a mountain pub.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>We at On The Snow absolutely LOVE <strong>Pepe Osaka\'s Fishtaco</strong>. It\'s hard to really describe the unique goodness that you\'ll find here. It\'s technically Asian-Mexican Fusion, as they put an Asian spin on Mexican favorites like ceviche, carne asada and nachos. The cocktails are amazing as they have various infused tequilas they use for margarites and other premium mixed drinks. Oh, and the tacos are increidible as well!&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Anyone who enjoys green chili MUST visit <strong>The Ditch on 40</strong>. Try out the unqiue spin on wontons with the New Mexican Juantans, with both red and green dipping chili.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Those wanting to go on a bit more upscale date would do well to visit&nbsp;<strong>Deno\'s Mountain Bistro.&nbsp;</strong>This 45-year establishment has a fantastic wine list and great steak and seafood options. The pizza is quite good as well!</li>\r\n<li>Another great option by the slopes ist&nbsp;<strong>Vertical Bistro&nbsp;</strong>at the base of the resort. Check out the Avo-Rado sandwhich with chipotle ranch and melted gouda.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 > Apr&egrave;s/Nightlife</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Idlewild Spirits Distillery&nbsp;</strong>has really upped the nightlife game in Winter Park.

  'description': 'Aspen Mountain Terrain</h2>\r\n<h3>Ski the Mountain&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p class="p1">Aspen Mountain has been offering black diamond skiing directly above the town of Aspen since 1947. Though somewhat small in size, Aspen Mountain offers every kind of terrain in a compact, accessible package. The knowledgeable skier can maximize vertical by linking together fall line runs all over the mountain. From steeps to bumps to trees, Aspen Mountain is a terrain smorgasbord, accessed by a state-of-the-art gondola (iTunes docks included) and eight lifts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1">The total elevation is 11,212 feet with a base elevation of 7,945 feet and a total vertical drop of 3,267 feet. The breakout is 0% beginner, 48% intermediate, 26% advanced and 26% expert. The longest run is 3 miles. There is a total of 673 skiable acres and 300 inches of snow bolstered by snowmaking on 31% of the area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers and Family</h3>\r\n<p>Aspen Mountain boasts 76 runs. The steepest one, Silver Queen, sits at an angle of 42 degrees. Aspen Mountain isn&rsquo;t ideal for beginners, but it&rsquo;s possible to ski the upper mountain while avoiding Spar Gulch and Copper Bowl, the two main top-to-botton funnel runs, which tend to intimidate families and beginner skiers. Ski off Chairs Seven, Three or Six to find some intermediate terrain at the top of the mountain. Don&rsquo;t miss Ruthie&rsquo;s Run, quite possibly the most consistent, fall line groomer in Colorado. The entire family will enjoy Bonnie&rsquo;s, a midmountain restaurant serving legendary white bean chili and apple strudel with homemade whipped cream. Its famous two-tiered outdoor deck is a favorite hangout spot.</p>\r\n<h2>Snowmass Terrain</h2>\r\n<h3>Ski the Mountain&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>Snowmass is actually the larger of the four mountains with a base elevation of 8,104 feet and a top elevation of 12,510 feet for a total of 4,406 feet of vertical. It also features 3,132 skiable acres serviced by 21 lifts. Unlike Aspen Mountain, there is some dedicated beginner terrain, breaking out 6% beginner, 50% intermediate and 44% expert. Like Aspen Mountain, it also receives 300 inches of snowfall each year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Snowmass has a total of 94 runs with 3 terrain parks, including a Superpipe and a minipipe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers and Family</h3>\r\n<p>Snowmass is known for its family-friendly activities as well wide-open, groomed areas. It is consistently rated a top skiing destination for families. If you don\'t want to ski the whole time, the entire family can enjoy the Breathtaker Alpine Coaster and the Ullr Nights.&nbsp;</p>'},

American, United, Delta and Continental all fly into Eagle. Wintertime direct flights are available from major cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Denver International Airport is 120 miles from Beaver Creek. You can book nonstop or direct flights from most major U.S. airlines to fly into Denver including United, Frontier, Southwest, Delta, American, Continental and Jet Blue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1"><strong>Transportation to/from the Airport</strong></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Several companies offer shuttle services in shared vans, or limousines and private cars. The major rental car companies have airport booths, but the car lots are several miles away. It\'s best to book in advance and ask for an SUV or a winterized car. If there\'s a snowstorm, you\'ll want snow tires on the car. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Colorado Mountain Express offers both shared rides in vans and private car service to and from both Eagle County Airport and Denver International Airport.

If you\'re staying up in Beaver Creek Village or in Bachelor Gulch, parking is expensive and you don\'t need a car unless you\'re planning to explore the region and head to Vail or Edwards for dinner. Beaver Creek\'s buses shuttle skiers between the covered bridge at the base of the lifts, and the free parking lots at the base of the resort, and between the resort\'s villages (Beaver Creek, Bachelor Gulch, Arrowhead). ECO Transit runs buses from the Elk and Bear Lots at the base of Beaver Creek to Vail with stops along the way.&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': "<h3>Terrain</h3>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek Resort offers terrain for all ability levels. Arrowhead Village and Bachelor Gulch have great beginner and intermediate terrain. Centennial is a perfect cruiser, steep enough for advanced skiers to let it out at speed, but wide enough for intermediates to make lots of turns. There are 19 beginner, 43 intermediate and 38 advanced runs. The longest run is 2.75 miles, and there are three terrain parks.</p>\r\n<p>The trees between most runs at Beaver Creek are tight, so make sure your skills are advanced enough before steering off a run. Midseason when the snow is good, intermediates can try Coyote Glade.</p>\r\n<p>If chutes are your game, the Upper and Lower Stone Creek Chutes are steep and narrow, and the snow is often deep. Cliff bands mixed with glades give skiers shots from 400 to 600 vertical feet, with pitches up to 45 degrees.</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers &amp; Family</h3>\r\n<p>Latigo and Gold Dust on Beaver Creek Mountain are long, easy intermediate trails, wide enough to make big turns. The entrances to Red Tail and Upper Harrier aren't obvious, so many skiers pass by, leaving these intermediate trails less tracked. The biggest spread of beginner and easy intermediate trails surround the Bachelor Gulch Express and Arrow Bahn Express lifts that are a cat-track away from the main mountain. If you're lodging in Bachelor Gulch or Arrowhead Village, just look uphill. Some beginner trails here curve through wooded areas, so skiers and riders get a sense of what it's like to ski through the trees.</p>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek is one of the rare mountains where novices and intermediates alike head straight to the mountaintop for 360-degree views while skiing on a network of green and blue trails. Halfway down some of the green runs off the Cinch Express lift, skiers exiting off lifts from more advanced trails spill onto the runs. From the top, go skier's right to Red Buffalo, Booth Gardens and the other trails for a more isolated beginner's playground.</p>\r\n<p>Beaver Creek is also very kid-friendly with kids&rsquo; adventure zones placed around the mountain.</p>"},

  'description': "<p>Beaver Creek has far fewer skiers than its neighbors to the east, so it's easier to find powder even late in the day. Grab a grooming report before taking the first chairlift ride so you'll know where the powder&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n<p>Many days only half of Larkspur Bowl is groomed, and the rest is pure powder. If the Centennial Trail is un-groomed, catch one of the first chairlifts up and then turn around and head right back down for an extended powder skiing romp.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When it snows all day, you'll even find advanced skiers floating through powder on the green runs off the Cinch Express at the very top of Beaver Creek. The high-speed quad in Rose Bowl promises powder much of the day, too. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On big dump days, the runs under the Birds of Prey chairlift are tempting, but be aware that the fluffy-looking surface usually hides big moguls. Experts race to Grouse Mountain early for freshies on Royal Elk Glade and Black Bear, both double-black diamonds.</p>"}],

  'description': '<p>Breckenridge Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p>Breck is situated in the Rockies and is nestled along the Tenmile Range&mdash;making it an ideal location for skiers and riders of all skill levels. The mountain features four base areas that make up its 2,908 acres of skiable terrain including smooth groomers, a 22-foot halfpipe, and some standout steeps.</p>\r\n<p>On a bluebird powder day, skiers and riders should head up to Horseshoe Bowl, North Bowl and Whale&rsquo;s Tail on the Imperial Express SuperChair&mdash;the highest chairlift in North America. You can also access this area via the T-Bar on Peak 7. Here you will find wide-open, double black diamond skiing. If steeps are your thing, head left from the top of the Imperial chair and work Easy Street and the rest of the Lake Chutes.</p>\r\n<p>Because this portion of the ski area is above treeline, visibility can be compromised during snowstorms. If that\'s the case, Breck&rsquo;s tree runs off the back of Peak 9 and E-Chair are a good alternative. For the experienced and fit, there is excellent hike-to, inbound terrain off the top of E-Chair. Once the bowls get tracked out, head over to the Falcon Chair and ski The Burn or the countless black diamond runs that Peak 10 has to offer.</p>\r\n<h3 > Breckenridge Terrain</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 6</strong></p>\r\n<p>They don&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;Serenity Bowl&rdquo; for nothing. From the top of the super chair, hike about 10 minutes to the 12,573-foot Peak 6 summit, head skier&rsquo;s right, and drop in. With boot-deep powder and a wide-open bowl, it feels like backcountry&mdash;but with regular ski patrol avalanche control, it&rsquo;s safer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 7</strong></p>\r\n<p>Serviced by the Independence SuperChair, Peak 7 is packed full of blue cruiser runs which are ideal for intermediate skiers and riders. Skirt the northernmost boundary of the resort on Monte Cristo or rip fast laps on Pioneer. Whether you want to be mellow or work on your GS turns, this is the place for you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 8</strong></p>\r\n<p>What isn&rsquo;t there to love about Peak 8? First, there&rsquo;s the Imperial Express, the highest elevation chairlift in North America (which delivers you to some of the resort&rsquo;s best terrain, by the way). Then there&rsquo;s the T-Bar, a buzzing watering hole with an extensive beer, wine, and cocktail choices. There&rsquo;s also the outdoor stage that comes out in the spring and hosts live music and, finally, there&rsquo;s Freeway, where you might catch Shaun White practicing on the four massive jumps, myriad rails, and boxes or the 22-foot Superpipe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 9</strong></p>\r\n<p>Chances are, you&rsquo;re no Olympian, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t push your own limits. This season you can race on the EpicMix racecourse. Race yourself, your friends, or even four-time overall World Cup Champion and Olympic Gold Medalist, Lindsey Vonn. Find the EpicMix Race Course on Peak 9: from the Beaver Run Superchair, ride Sundown to the race location.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peak 10</strong></p>\r\n<p>Challenge yourself on some of Breck&rsquo;s toughest terrain and get there fast on the speedy Falcon SuperChair. Known as a &ldquo;Bi&rdquo; or Bicentennial Peak, it&rsquo;s on the top 200 highest in the state of Colorado and offers spectacular views of the Tenmile Range.</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p>Breckenridge doesn&rsquo;t have its own tubing park, but you can visit the Frisco Adventure Park just 20 minutes from Breckenridge. It features a multi-lane tubing hill and beginner ski &amp; ride hill, both serviced by an easy-to-use surface lift. The Adventure Park also includes the Frisco Nordic Center, which offers 27 kilometers of ski trails, 20 kilometers of snowshoe trails, rentals, skate or classic lessons, and ski tuning seven days a week.</p>\r\n<p>Carter Park, Breck&rsquo;s sledding hill, is located at the south end of High Street adjacent to the Breckenridge Elementary School. It&rsquo;s free--just bring your own sled and some hot cocoa!</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>The Breckenridge Nordic Center is located just a minute&rsquo;s drive from downtown Breckenridge and 90 minutes from Denver. It has 2,000 acres of groomed cross-country skiing and snowshoe trails. After your day out on the trails, enjoy food and drink specials and beautiful views from their handcrafted log lodge.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Things to Do in Breckenridge</h2>\r\n<h3 > Breckenridge Essentials</h3>\r\n<p>As one of the most popular resorts in Colorado, Breck can get crowded very fast, especially on a powder day. Avoid a long line on T-bar or Imperial on Peak 8 by hitting runs like Little Johnny&rsquo;s, which still offers plenty of powder under the Rocky Mountain Super Chair while you wait for a break in the T-bar queue.</p>\r\n<p>Escape the crowds and go where the locals go, Motherload Tavern. This family-friendly establishment offers a relaxing atmosphere, chill back patio and home-cooked meals.

  'description': '<p>Located only 90 miles west of Denver International Airport, <strong>Copper Mountain</strong> is a conveniently located resort known for almost 2,500 acres of naturally divided terrain. While many resorts try to create distinct sections for each level of skier, Copper truly accomplishes this with a wide variety of runs within each section. Copper also offers a unique experience for expert skiers with free cat skiing on Tucker Mountain.</p>\r\n<p>Among Colorado\'s first ski resorts to open in November, the base at <strong>Copper Mountain</strong> is at 9,712 feet with a resort summit elevation of 12,312 feet, it is an excellent family destination&nbsp;with youth and adult seasonal ski and ride school programs that up the ante on progression, plenty of mellow groomers and&nbsp;a wide array of activities besides skiing and snowboarding, including zip lines, tubing, snowshoeing, ice skating and more.</p>\r\n<p>While locals can easily make the 1.5-2 hour drive from Denver and back in one day, those wanting to spend days at <strong>Copper Mountain&nbsp;</strong>have a bevy of options available. Condos, townhomes and private homes are available throughout the distinct base areas: East Village, with quick access to more challenging terrain off the Super Bee Lift; Center Village that\'s steps away from the shopping and dining of Burning Stones Plaza and great intermediate runs via American Flyer and American Eagle Lifts; and West Village, the ski school hub surrounded by family-friendly beginner terrain. You also can find lodging in nearby towns of Silverthorne and Dillon.&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': '<h2>Copper Mountain Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine ski area</h3>\r\n<p>Copper Mountain is a unique resort with terrain that is naturally divided into beginner, intermediate, and expert areas, each located on different parts of the mountain and each generally served by its own lifts.</p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>beginner terrain&nbsp;</strong>is located in the West Village, where you will find the Schoolhouse, the meeting area for all child and adult&nbsp;<strong>ski school.&nbsp;</strong>From the village you can take Woodward Express for eight unique beginner runs, or take Kokomo Express for the most beginner option taking Roundabout back down for quick runs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Intermediate skiers&nbsp;</strong>have incredible options that mostly start from the Center Village. Located directly in the middle of the resort, Amerianc Eagle lift is a 6-seater tha provides immediate options to get your runs in, including Main Vein which is located directly under the lift. There are four main runs that you can do from that lift, but from there, if you go over to Excellerator lift, there are ten more runs that await you on the east side of the mountain. Finally, there are seven intermediate runs on the west side of the mountain as well that will require you to take American Flyer from the Center Village.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The main area for<strong> advanced and expert skiing</strong> starts in the East village, where Super Bee lift will take you to many options. To the south of that lift are multiple bowls and incredible expert terrain, but if you prefer great advanced options you may want to take Collage or Andy\'s Encore, both intermediate runs, down to the Alpine lift where you will find many additional advanced options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country skiing and snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>Copper Mountain supports skinning by actually offering uphill tours in a safe and non-threatening environment. It is great for those who have never skinned before or if you just want a great cardio workout with a 1,000 vertical feet ascent! Note that this is an all-day activity from 9:30a-3p. There are also multiple cross-country trails that start from the west village for those who don\'t want a guided experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Snowshoers will be glad to know that there are two separate free snowshoeing tours available Friday-Sunday. The morning tour is more physically demanding and you must be at least 15 years old, but families can go together in the afternoon tours (must be 8 years old to join). The tours are free, but you will need to rent shoes (unless you bring your own).&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': '<h2>Things to Do at Copper Mountain</h2>\r\n<h3 > Mammoth Mountain Essentials</h3>\r\n<p>- Cat skiing is free at Copper and definitely worth checking out.

The Gold Link Family Cross Course is a family-friendly skier and boarder cross track.</p>\r\n<p>The resort is a great place to get those untouched powder lines because of the lack of crowds and short lift lines.

But don&rsquo;t be fooled; with seven terrain parks and multitudes of challenging mogul runs to explore, advanced skiers and riders are sure to be entertained.</p>\r\n<p>Purgatory offers an impressive vertical drop of 2,028 feet situated across 1,360 acres of skiable terrain. With an annual snowfall of 260 inches, the terrain is divided into 20% beginner, 45% intermediate and 35% advanced to expert that can be accessed via 12 lifts.</p>'},

  'description': '<h3>From Where does the Name Purgatory Come?</h3>\r\n<p>The exact origin of the Purgatory name is disputed; some attribute the name to a 1776 Spanish expedition where several Spanish explorers were lost on the nearby Animas River. The bodies were never found, and the explorers named the river, &ldquo;El Rio de las Animan Perdidas&rdquo; or the River of Lost Souls.</p>\r\n<p>Another theory is that miners who were trying to travel from Durango to Silverton would have to pay a toll to access the road. Miners who couldn&rsquo;t afford the toll were stationed at area called Purgatory Flats because they were stuck in limbo between heading to Silverton or turning around and heading home.</p>\r\n<h3>Other Activities at Purgatory Resort</h3>\r\n<p>During the summer, the mountain turns into a biker&rsquo;s paradise with miles of cross country and downhill riding access from uphill trails or lifts. Other actives include a mountain roller coaster and music festivals.</p>'}],

'description': [{'tab': 'resort_profile',
  'description': "<p>Steamboat Ski Resort is a premier ski destination famous for its Champagne Powder&reg;. The mountain is also known for its unique aspen glades, offering up some of the best tree skiing in North America.</p>\r\n<p>Founded in 1963, Steamboat Ski Resort is situated across seven mountain peaks within the Park Range and overlooks the Yampa Valley. The area has a rich western heritage and cowboy vibe that's celebrated throughout many annual events held on the mountain and in town, including the Cowboy Downhill and the Steamboat Winter Carnival.</p>\r\n<p>One of the largest ski resorts in Colorado, Steamboat Springs has been dubbed Ski Town, U.S.A. &reg;, due to the fact that more Olympians call Steamboat home than any other ski resort. It&rsquo;s one of Colorado's best family-friendly ski resorts.</p>\r\n<p>Steamboat Ski Resort has over 4.6 square miles (2,965 acres) of skiable terrain, 169 named trails, and 18 lifts. The base elevation is 6,900 feet, and the summit elevation is 10,568 feet. The vertical rise is 3,668 feet.</p>\r\n<p>The resort is located just outside of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. It&rsquo;s about a 3-hour drive from Denver and an hour and a half from Summit County.</p>"},
 {'tab': 'transportation_profile',
  'description': '<p class="p1"><strong>Airports</strong></p>\r\n<p class="p1">The closest airport to Steamboat is Yampa Valley Regional Airport (HDN), 20 miles west of the resort. United is the only year-round major carrier, but during winter months carriers include American (from Dallas/Ft. Worth and Chicago), Delta (from Minneapolis and Atlanta), Frontier (from Denver), and Continental (from Houston). If you&rsquo;re on a budget first look at flying into Denver (DEN) approximately three hours to the southwest and renting a car or booking a Go Alpine shuttle (see below).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1"><strong>From The Airport</strong></p>\r\n<p class="p1">Check first with your lodging provider to see if airport shuttles are included with your stay. If they aren&rsquo;t &mdash;and that will be the case if you&rsquo;re flying into Denver International&mdash;plan on renting a car or booking a shuttle through <a href="http://goalpine.com" target="_blank"><strong>Go Alpine</strong></a> (800-343-RIDE), which offers transportation from both airports. Shared service and private airport limo service from HDN can also be arranged with <a href="http://stormmountainexpress.com" target="_blank"><strong>Storm Mountain Express</strong></a> (877-844-8787). Just don&rsquo;t expect any public transportation, it doesn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1"><strong>Getting Around Once You&rsquo;re There</strong></p>\r\n<p class="p1">You don&rsquo;t strictly need a car. Steamboat&rsquo;s base area is pedestrian-friendly, and so is downtown Steamboat Springs (located four miles from the resort), but getting between the two requires wheels. As you consider lodging options, check their shuttle service: Some (but not all) provide rides to the lifts or to town. No shuttle? Ask about bus-stop proximity. Steamboat Springs operates a free bus system linking the base area to the town and area condos.&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Best Restaurants &amp; Bars in Steamboat</h2>\r\n<h3 > For Breakfast</h3>\r\n<p>Situated at the edge of town, <strong>Creekside Caf&eacute;</strong> serves up sizable breakfast and lunch dishes, including unique and specialty creations like the Wafflelaughagus. The Bloody Mary at this quaint caf&eacute; is equally sizable and a standout.</p>\r\n<p>Located between downtown and the resort, <strong>Freshies&nbsp;</strong>crams rainbow-hued veggies and top-quality cheeses (like aged white cheddar) into Steamboat&rsquo;s best omelets. The sweets are fantastic, too. Try the famous cinnamon rolls or a plate of dried cherry granola pancakes. Colorful pendant lamps and exotic fresh flowers (never carnations!) complement the colorful food.</p>\r\n<p>Right there on the main strip, smack in the middle of town, <strong>Winona\'s Restaurant &amp; Bakery</strong> serves up world-famous homemade cinnamon rolls that will spoil your appetite. Share it with at least one or two others, and then settle in for a huge selection of breakfast and lunch options.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch</h3>\r\n<p>Glide into <strong>Hazie&rsquo;s&nbsp;</strong>for top-of-the-gondola panoramas over the Yampa Valley. Reserve a table next to the floor-to-ceiling windows to admire the distant Flat Tops while you enjoy a delicious meal. Hazie&rsquo;s bar, a brass-and-mahogany affair, also turns out a respectable Bloody Mary.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Dinner</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Caf<strong>&eacute;</strong> Diva</strong> is the base area&rsquo;s most romantic restaurant, with tables tucked into tiny alcoves and expert wait staff that make diners feel special. The restaurant specializes in locally sourced meats and produce.</p>\r\n<p>For a low-key spot that&rsquo;s still high bar about its food, try <strong>Mazzola&rsquo;s Italian Diner</strong>. This downtown pizza-and-pasta joint feels like a spiffy basement speakeasy, and its chummy servers welcome you as a member of the club.</p>\r\n<h3 > Apres &amp; Nightlife</h3>\r\n<p>Bar service is notoriously slow at <strong>Slopeside Grill</strong>, a ski-in, stagger-out bar located adjacent to the Christie III lift - but nobody cares. On sunny afternoons, this slope side joint resembles Daytona Beach as hordes of revelers strip down and belly up to the open-air ice bar.</p>\r\n<p>The upscale <strong>Truffle Pig Restaurant</strong> offers a great happy hour with seriously cheap beer and well drinks along with some munchies to tide you over for dinner.</p>'},
 {'tab': 'mountain_overview',
  'description': '<p>Steamboat Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p>Unlike some ski areas, where the <strong>best beginner and intermediate terrain</strong> is located near the base, Steamboat&rsquo;s friendliest groomers are at the very top. Nicknamed &ldquo;Wally World,&rdquo; the blue runs served by the Sunshine Express Lift are mellow and wide. The trees bordering these runs are similarly forgiving and allow bolder members of the family to weave among the pines while more timid skiers stick to the open run - all the while staying within yards of one another. Plus, Wally World is first to catch the sun&rsquo;s rays, a plus on nippy mornings. On the lower mountain, be sure to hit Swinger: This green slope runs parallel to the always-jammed Right-O-Way and sees so little traffic that it offers uncut corduroy late into the afternoon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Steamboat&rsquo;s signature runs</strong> are Closets and Shadows, two sublimely long tree shots that are deservedly famous: When the pow is deep and soft, there&rsquo;s no finer tree skiing anywhere in North America. The catch? Everybody heads here for that postcard-perfect experience, so solitude is elusive, and the goods get gobbled fast. For a shorter (but less trafficked) version of Steamboat&rsquo;s celebrated tree-skiing, try Hot Cakes in Morningside Park.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For bumps</strong>, ride the Burgess Creek Lift, which accesses Norther (a blue-black that&rsquo;s mellow enough to let most skiers take the zipper-line) as well as White Out (Steamboat&rsquo;s best bump run). Or, ride the Four Points Lift and hammer Nelson&rsquo;s Run. Named for Olympic bronze medalist Nelson Carmichael (one of 84 Olympians that hail from Steamboat Springs, more than any other town in the U.S.), Nelson&rsquo;s big moguls and multiple fall lines demand expert mettle.</p>\r\n<p>If your guilty pleasure is rocketing down <strong>groomers</strong>, start your day on Heavenly Daze or Vagabond. By afternoon, these big boulevards become thoroughfares for barn-bound skiers, but in the morning, these intermediate runs make for gleeful first flights.</p>\r\n<h3 > Game Plan for a Powder Day at Steamboat</h3>\r\n<p>Get to the gondola at least 45 minutes before it opens. Riding the Silver Bullet is still the best and fastest way to the goods, and diehard powder-hounds take pride in &ldquo;pressing glass&rdquo; (being the first in line at the sliding glass doors of the gondola loading dock). Exiting the gondola, most traffic heads for the Storm Peak Express lift, which accesses the summit - but that doesn&rsquo;t open until 9 a.m. Don&rsquo;t wait there: instead, ride the Pony Express Lift. Snowstorms out of the south deposit heaps of powder on the stashes off Pioneer Ridge, which offer some of the mountain&rsquo;s longest runs. Plus, the masses don&rsquo;t usually head this way until after 10:30 a.m.</p>\r\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve plundered the easy pickings, take Storm Peak lift to ski Morningside Bowl, and ride Morningside Lift, which accesses the hike-to terrain off the top of Mt. Werner. These four gated access points offer up the resort&rsquo;s deepest snow. The choicest terrain sits beyond Gate C (North St. Pat&rsquo;s), which mixes wide, tree-lined alleys with narrow chutes and cliffy, mandatory-air lines. If the snowfall (and your muscles) stick around through the afternoon, hit the trees on skier&rsquo;s left of Storm Peak Face: these stashes often get neglected after the early-morning stampede.</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p>For kids (and kids at heart), don&rsquo;t miss Saddleback Ranch\'s Yee-Haw Tubing Hill. The hill is groomed and equipped with a state of the art tube-tow lift system that attaches itself to the tube to transport you back to the top. From there, speed down the hill on a large inner tube provided by the ranch. At the bottom, warm up in the Longhorn Warming Lodge, grab a bite to eat or a warm drink from the concession stand and hit the slope again.</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>The Haymaker Nordic Center has 8km of groomed trails for classic skiing, skate skiing and snowshoeing, all ability levels welcome.</p>\r\n<p>The Steamboat Ski Touring Center offers 15 km of trails groomed for classic and skate skiing for novice to advanced skiers, plus 10 km of snowshoe trails. The trails wind across meadows, into Aspen groves, and along Fish Creek, offering some of the most enjoyable and accessible winter recreation in the Yampa Valley. Hearty homemade lunches and snacks are available all day at The Picnic Basket in the Nordic Clubhouse.</p>\r\n<p>You can also explore the Yampa Valley\'s singletrack by fat bike.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Vail Ski Resort is world-renowned for providing guests with an experience that truly is &ldquo;Like nothing on Earth.&rdquo; Founded in 1962, the Colorado resort is home to seven legendary back bowls spanning seven miles across the backside of the resort. The ski area is enormous with over 5,289 acres to explore and four distinct base areas connected by free buses and heated walkways. It draws skiers from all over the world and provides excellent terrain for all ability levels.</span></p>\r\n<p dir="ltr"><span></span>The resort has great terrain options, excellent ski schools and a large assortment of shopping and dining options. The two main base areas are Vail Village and Lionshead. Vail Village located at the base of Gondola One is the original base area and is home to Vail&rsquo;s iconic covered bridge that crosses Gore Creek. Lionshead Village, located just west of Vail Village, is serviced by its own gondola and is home to luxury resorts.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Denver to Vail is about 1.5 hours &ndash; or more depending on traffic. It is 100 miles from Denver International Airport and 30 miles east of Eagle County Regional Airport (EGE). There are plenty of shuttle services to Vail. Once you get to Vail, you can navigate the town by bus for free.</p>\r\n<p dir="ltr">Vail is a great destination for many skiers, but the resort can get crowded on the weekends. So, check the chair lift status signs at strategic intersections on the mountain to avoid backups. A yellow light means the lift maze is full so choose an alternative route if possible. A green light means you are good to go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 dir="ltr">Vail Ski Resort History</h2>\r\n<p>While many other ski resorts in the western United States started as mining towns, Vail was built from the ground up to be a ski resort. During World War II the U.S. Army established a training center at Camp Hale located just 14 miles south of what would later become Vail Mountain. The U.S. Army&rsquo;s 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Mountain Division trained at Camp Hale and consisted of excellent skiers and mountaineers that fought in the mountains of northern Italy during WWII. Upon their return from the war, they quickly became major players in the burgeoning ski industry.</p>\r\n<p>A veteran of the 10<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Mountain Division, Pete Seibert returned to Colorado after the war to search for a perfect location to build a ski area in the Rocky Mountain region. Pete teamed up with friend Earl Eaton who led Pete on a seven-hour climb up a no-name mountain, where they crested the summit to discover the now legendary back bowls.</p>'},

While it is only 60 miles from Denver, it is separated by huge mountain ranges and therefore has a very remote feel to it.</p>\r\n<p>The ski area is known for being a very family friendly resort and has terrain for all ability types. Winter Park contains over 3,000 skiable acres that span across two distinct mountains and is home to a majority of beginner and intermediate trails. Mary Jane Mountain is home to amazing tree skiing, world-class moguls and wide open alpine bowls.</p>\r\n<p>The resort contains modern amenities with an extensive well developed trail system. The village base contains multiple lodging, dining and shopping options.</p>\r\n<p>While the main way to reach Winter Park is by I-70 West and US-40 (about 1.5 hours from Denver), you can also reach the slopes by train. The double-decker Winter Park Express is a weekends-only 2-hour train ride from downtown Union Station to Winter Park. It does sell out so buy your tickets early!</p>'},

  'description': '<h2>Best restaurants and bars in Winter Park</h2>\r\n<p>While there are a few options on-mountain, most of the best dining you\'ll find in Winter Park is in the actual city, which is less than 10 minutes north of the slopes.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Breakfast</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you need more hearty meals before heading to the slopes, stop by <strong>Wake N&rsquo; Bacon</strong>. From chicken biscuits to pancakes to breakfast sandwiches, you&rsquo;re bound to find something hearty and delicious to eat.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Since 1982, <strong>Carver&rsquo;s Bakery Cafe</strong> has been providing Winter Park visitors and residents with fresh-baked goodies and drip coffee and espresso drinks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch and Dinner</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The best dining at the resort (base of the mountain) is hands down&nbsp;<strong>Rippy\'s Mountain Tavern.&nbsp;</strong>Big burgers, steaks, wings and sandwiches with fresh sides, it\'s everything you\'d want from a mountain pub.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>We at On The Snow absolutely LOVE <strong>Pepe Osaka\'s Fishtaco</strong>. It\'s hard to really describe the unique goodness that you\'ll find here. It\'s technically Asian-Mexican Fusion, as they put an Asian spin on Mexican favorites like ceviche, carne asada and nachos. The cocktails are amazing as they have various infused tequilas they use for margarites and other premium mixed drinks. Oh, and the tacos are increidible as well!&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Anyone who enjoys green chili MUST visit <strong>The Ditch on 40</strong>. Try out the unqiue spin on wontons with the New Mexican Juantans, with both red and green dipping chili.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Those wanting to go on a bit more upscale date would do well to visit&nbsp;<strong>Deno\'s Mountain Bistro.&nbsp;</strong>This 45-year establishment has a fantastic wine list and great steak and seafood options. The pizza is quite good as well!</li>\r\n<li>Another great option by the slopes ist&nbsp;<strong>Vertical Bistro&nbsp;</strong>at the base of the resort. Check out the Avo-Rado sandwhich with chipotle ranch and melted gouda.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 > Apr&egrave;s/Nightlife</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Idlewild Spirits Distillery&nbsp;</strong>has really upped the nightlife game in Winter Park. They have an intense love for whiskey and is a great place to visit for an after dinner drink (or for dinner as well, as they do have a tapas menu).&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Goodys Mountain Creperie</strong> is perfect at any time of day, but they&rsquo;re known for their apr&egrave;s snacks and happy hour menu.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Heck&rsquo;s Tavern</strong> is located on Devil&rsquo;s Thumb Ranch, and it offers amazing views along with plenty of pre-dinner snacks and cocktails.</li>\r\n</ul>'},

  'description': '<h2>Winter Park Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine ski area</h3>\r\n<p>The resort divides its terrain between two different mountains: Mary Jane and Winter Park. Each mountain is unique with its own distinct characteristics. Winter Park contains long wide groomed trails and is home to Winter Park&rsquo;s renowned ski and ride school. Vasquez Ridge is off the beaten path and contains some powder stashes hidden away within the intermediate to advanced trails.</p>\r\n<p>Winter Park ski resort has 3,081 skiable acres that are broken up into seven territories. Check out the Winter Park site for more details on the distinct territories and where you should aim to spend the majority of your day based on your skills and terrain preferences.</p>\r\n<p>Mary Jane is home to legendary tree skiing and mogul runs. At the top of Parsenn Bowl, skiers and riders are met with spectacular 360 degree views. Parsenn Bowl offers skiers and riders an intermediate friendly high-alpine experience. Off the Eagle Wind chairlift is home to excellent tree skiing and steep glades.</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p>The Coca-Cola Tube Park in Winter Park is the newest tube park in Colorado that features three separate lanes with banked curves and a covered conveyor lifts that take riders from the bottom to the top. When not tubing you can sit back and enjoy gourmet hot chocolate and snacks at the Hill House. The park is conveniently located adjacent to the Vintage Hotel with easy access to village restaurants via the Cabriolet.</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross Country and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>Winter Park is fantastic for nordic skiing, with over 80 miles of trails throughout Winter Park and Fraser. There are four main trail hubs: Devil&rsquo;s Thumb, Snow Mountain Ranch, Ski Granby Ranch and Grand Lake Nordic Center. Trails range from quite easy (Grand Park Loop) to a much more difficult Deadhorse Loop Trail which spans 7 miles and a 1,300 ft. incline.</p>'},

The gondola takes you up to over 10,000 feet, giving you great views of the Continental Divid and the Fraser Valley. You can dine at the top as Sunspot mountaintop lodge offers&nbsp;<span>lunch, apr&egrave;s, and dinner.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Kids\' Night Out at Camp Idlewild is a fun event for kids 6-12 years in age.

Its a great opportunity for parents to have a night on the town while the kids get a unique night on the mountain.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>If you\'ve ever wanted to see a Tour Cat in operation, you can jump in a 90-minute Snow Cat tour through the Arapaho National Forest. You can also choose an evening tour that includes S\'Mores.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Main Events in Winter Park</h3>\r\n<p>While there are many small events constantly going on in the summer, the largest is Village Uncorked, a day focused on wine and food in the mountains. This event takes place the weekend of the fourth of July every&nbsp; year alongside the Run for Independence, so get a good 5-mile run in before enjoying tasting fantastic wines the rest of the day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'}],

  'description': '<h2>Big Sky Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine ski area</h3>\r\n<p>Big Sky Resort boasts an impressive vertical rise of 4,350 feet. The mountain&rsquo;s summit of 11,166 feet is serviced by the Lone Peak Tram that grants access to chutes and wide expansive bowls. From the top of the Lone Peak Tram, skiers and riders are able to see three states on a clear day, including Wyoming and Idaho. It is a truly unique experience for any outdoor lover!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While the resort is known for impressive advanced and expert runs, it has over 2,300 acres for beginner and intermediate skiing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before getting into the different areas of the mountain and where to find the best runs for each skill level, we must talk about the Ramcharger 8 chairlift. Heated seats! This eight-seat lift with a weather-proof bubble debuted in 2018 and is a truly unique experience within the sport. This isn\'t a gondola; it is a modern lift that you won\'t find anywhere else in North America. The fact that this high-speed lift drops you off in the middle of Andesite Mountain that highlights the best beginner and intermediate runs on the mountain (as well as some advanced runs) will ensure you make the most of your day on the mountain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, if you are a&nbsp;<strong>beginner skier,&nbsp;</strong>you\'ll want to stay on Andesite and Spirit mountains where there is a wide variety of beginner terrain. The combination of Lewis &amp; Clark, Southern Comfort and the aforementioned Ramcharger 8 lifts will keep you on beginner terrain all day. Those truly experience skiing or boarding for the first time will want to stay at the Explorer area near the village.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For&nbsp;<strong>intermediate skiers,&nbsp;</strong>the middle of the resort has a wide variety; either use Ramcharger or hunder Wolf to experience long, open runs like Big Horn or a bit steeper run amongh the trees like Tippy\'s Tumble. The Swift Curret high-speed lift also has a good amount of intermediate runs interspersed among the advanced runs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Then for those&nbsp;<strong>advanced or expert skiers,&nbsp;</strong>you are in for a treat. It is impossible to recap all of the options for those seeking a truly unique adventure; you can go up to Lone Mountain, take in the view, and then spend hours in the numerous expert options available to you. For the advanced skier, you\'ll want to head up Six Shooter and Lone Tree and enjoy the very long runs back down to base of the Six Shooter lift.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>Big Sky offers a two-hour snowshoe tour through the Moose Tracks Gully, departing daily from the Mountain Village at 1:00p. For cross-country skiers, there are over 50 miles of groomed trails at Lone Mountain Ranch. There are professional instructors to teach you if needed, and there are beginner to advanced trails for all levels of expertise.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': '<h2>Big Sky Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine ski area</h3>\r\n<p>Big Sky Resort boasts an impressive vertical rise of 4,350 feet. The mountain&rsquo;s summit of 11,166 feet is serviced by the Lone Peak Tram that grants access to chutes and wide expansive bowls. From the top of the Lone Peak Tram, skiers and riders are able to see three states on a clear day, including Wyoming and Idaho. It is a truly unique experience for any outdoor lover!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While the resort is known for impressive advanced and expert runs, it has over 2,300 acres for beginner and intermediate skiing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before getting into the different areas of the mountain and where to find the best runs for each skill level, we must talk about the Ramcharger 8 chairlift. Heated seats! This eight-seat lift with a weather-proof bubble debuted in 2018 and is a truly unique experience within the sport. This isn\'t a gondola; it is a modern lift that you won\'t find anywhere else in North America. The fact that this high-speed lift drops you off in the middle of Andesite Mountain that highlights the best beginner and intermediate runs on the mountain (as well as some advanced runs) will ensure you make the most of your day on the mountain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned above, if you are a&nbsp;<strong>beginner skier,&nbsp;</strong>you\'ll want to stay on Andesite and Spirit mountains where there is a wide variety of beginner terrain. The combination of Lewis &amp; Clark, Southern Comfort and the aforementioned Ramcharger 8 lifts will keep you on beginner terrain all day. Those truly experience skiing or boarding for the first time will want to stay at the Explorer area near the village.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For&nbsp;<strong>intermediate skiers,&nbsp;</strong>the middle of the resort has a wide variety; either use Ramcharger or hunder Wolf to experience long, open runs like Big Horn or a bit steeper run amongh the trees like Tippy\'s Tumble. The Swift Curret high-speed lift also has a good amount of intermediate runs interspersed among the advanced runs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Then for those&nbsp;<strong>advanced or expert skiers,&nbsp;</strong>you are in for a treat. It is impossible to recap all of the options for those seeking a truly unique adventure; you can go up to Lone Mountain, take in the view, and then spend hours in the numerous expert options available to you. For the advanced skier, you\'ll want to head up Six Shooter and Lone Tree and enjoy the very long runs back down to base of the Six Shooter lift.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>Big Sky offers a two-hour snowshoe tour through the Moose Tracks Gully, departing daily from the Mountain Village at 1:00p. For cross-country skiers, there are over 50 miles of groomed trails at Lone Mountain Ranch. There are professional instructors to teach you if needed, and there are beginner to advanced trails for all levels of expertise.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'},

The mountain has an impressive 10,440 foot summit elevation as well as a 1,440 vertical drop over 300 acres of skiable terrain. Pajarito sometimes serves up prodigous powder, and offers beautiful views of the Rio Grande Valley, and small crowds. Skiers and snowboarders have access to the mountain thanks to a quad lift, triple, 3 doubles and 1 rope tow. Sitting above Los Alamos in the Jemez Mountains, it was for years the private stash of scientists and their families but has been open to the general public for more than two decades. Pajarito offers rental services, retail facilities, a caf&eacute; dining option and a high quality snow sports school.&nbsp;</p>"},

  'description': '<h2>Best restaurants and bars at Taos Ski Valley</h2>\r\n<h3 > For Breakfast</h3>\r\n<p>&bull; While <strong>192 at The Blake</strong> is a great place to eat at any time of the day, their breakfast buffet is amazing. Inspired by seasonal and locally sourced ingredients the menu offers fresh New Mexican cuisine. Located on the second floor of The Blake Lodge at the Base Area of Taos Ski Valley, visitors can ski in/out or get room service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; The<strong> Black Diamond Espresso</strong> has two locations at Taos Ski Valley, one on the mountain and one at the base. It&rsquo;s a great place for a quick cup of joe or tasty nibble.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch and Dinner</h3>\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Tim&rsquo;s Stray Dog Cantina</strong> is a perfect representation of Northern New Mexican cuisine. Serving the Taos area for over 30 years, they are known for their green and red chili. Having won multiple awards, this local treasure is a must stop.</p>\r\n<p>&bull; The <strong>Bavarian Lodge &amp; Restaurant</strong> offers a gourmet menu with hearty dishes like Sauerbraten Wienerschnitzel, and K&auml;sesp&auml;tzle. Located at the base of Lift 4, the Bavarian Restaurant is the perfect place to grab a specialty beer or glass of wine after a long day on the mountain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&bull; I know we already mentioned <strong>192 at The Blake</strong> for breakfast, but it is a fantastic place for a dinner date as well with an extensive wine menu to pair with a great menu of small plates and entrees. Save room for the big skillet chocolate chip cookie!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\r\n<h3 > Apres/Nightlife</h3>\r\n<p>&bull; The Blonde Bear Tavern is a popular ski-in, ski-out destination for apres-ski. Order a pomegranate martini or a hot toddy and sit by the fireplace to warm up from the cold.&nbsp;</p>'},

  'description': '<h2>Taos Ski Valley Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine ski area</h3>\r\n<p>Taos Ski Valley is a strong intermediate and advanced mountain with over half of marked runs being advanced or expert. The mountain towers over the resort at 12,481 feet and offers some of the finest advanced to expert terrain in North America.&nbsp;For those looking to make some untouched powder turns, head to the top of Kachina Peak.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Taos Ski Valley has a nice variety of <strong>beginner runs</strong> off of lifts 4 and 7. Honeysuckle is Taos\' longest run off of lift 7 and goes all the way down to lift 4 through WInkelreid. White Feather is another longer beginner run with a very gentle grade right off of lift 1, but there\'s not much variety on the north side of the mountain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For&nbsp;<strong>intermediate skiing&nbsp;</strong>you will want to stay on the north side of the mountain and use lift 8 for a variety of intermediate options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While there are runs for all levels of skiers, Taos is definitely known best for the&nbsp;<strong>expert runs.&nbsp;</strong>One of the best runs is the easiest to get to: Longhorn. You just take lift 1 from the village and then you have the long mogule track directly to your left. While that is the best mogul run on the mountain, if you love steep, challenging runs, Taos is the place for you. Expert skiers must get to either Highline Ridge or West Basin Ridge and try one of the many steep double-black diamonds that await you there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'},

You just take lift 1 from the village and then you have the long mogule track directly to your left. While that is the best mogul run on the mountain, if you love steep, challenging runs, Taos is the place for you.

  'description': "<p>As the largest ski resort in the United States with over 7,300 skiable acres, Park City Mountain has much to boast about. The host to the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, <strong>Park City Mountain Resort</strong> is known as an essential world-class destination. It is a rare large resort that is in close proximity to an airport, as it is just a 35-minute drive east from Salt Lake City International Airport.</p>\r\n<p>Park City&nbsp;has three distinct base areas, six signature properties, and many diverse ski-in/ski-out hotel and lodging options. It's especially attractive for intermediate skiers, as close to half of its 348 trails are blue, intermediate runs. With 3,200 feet of vertical drop, there&rsquo;s also plenty of options for advanced and expert terrain lovers, along with 13 bowls and eight terrain parks. Despite its massive scale, Park City still offers many free parking options at the base of the village so you can easily get on the mountain.</p>\r\n<p>The four-season resort is situated at the center of the historic and idyllic town of Park City, Utah, with access to award-winning restaurants that are within walking distance or accessible via the city's free transportation system. If you come in January during the Sundance Film Festival for which Park City is known, you might find yourself rubbing elbows with celebrities out on the town.</p>"},

  'description': '<p>Best Restaurants and Bars at Park City Mountain</h2>\r\n<p>While there is a slew of great options throughout Park City, know that most of the best dining options will be found at the mountain village (vs. the Canyons Village) or on-mountain.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Breakfast</h3>\r\n<p>Located right in the Park City Mountain Village, <strong>Harvest</strong> has become a favorite for locals and destination guests alike. With a motto of &ldquo;Food. Coffee. People&rdquo;, Harvest offers a wide variety of options such as smoothies, smashed avocado toast and some of the best coffee in Park City. Those looking for healthier options will feel right at home.</p>\r\n<p>Those looking to carb up before a day on the slopes will appreciate <strong>The Bridge Caf&eacute; and Grill&rsquo;s</strong> Brazilian flair. Head here for pancakes, or maybe the Cristo Redentor, a french toast style ham and swiss cheese sandwich.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch</h3>\r\n<p>Located at the bottom of Tombstone Express you can find <strong>Tombstone BBQ</strong>, an authentic joint smoking meats daily. With brisket, pulled pork, smoked wings and multiple beers on tap, it is a great spot to get refueled under the sun.</p>\r\n<p>If you happen to be at the village for lunch, you have to check out <strong>Main St. Deli &amp; Eatery</strong> and grab a gourmet sandwich or salad. A staple for more than 30 years, they know food and they have a strong reputation among locals.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Dinner</h3>\r\n<p>Short rib grilled cheese! If those words excite you at all, then you must go and visit <strong>Fletcher&rsquo;s</strong>. This top spot in Park City is a bit on the pricier side and is only open for dinner, so make a reservation and enjoy a great night of unique eats.</p>\r\n<p>For more of a traditional grill pub, <strong>No Name Saloon and Grill</strong> is a great option. The ambiance is great and they have buffalo burgers and a large drink menu. It is definitely one of Main Street&rsquo;s best.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Park City Mountain Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p><strong></strong>As the largest resort in the United States, there are trails for every type of skier and boarder. Due to the massive scale, it is recommended that you study the trail map and know which areas will lead to your best day on the mountain. There are two bases (Mountain Village and Canyons Village) and both lead to many runs for skiers and boarders of all levels. Some key tips are below based on skill level:<br /><br /><strong>Beginner Terrain</strong> is primarily found at the Park City Mountain Village, with Crescent Express, King Con Express, and Bonanza Express all taking you to a variety of beginner terrain. There is also a premier learning environment called High Meadow Park which is at Canyons Village, a dedicated learning area that features three Adventure Alleys which are perfect for learning to ski for the first time. While High Meadows Park is on the Canyons side of the mountain, note that there is little variety for beginners there outside of High Meadows Park. <br /><br /><strong>Intermediate Terrain</strong> is everywhere and there&rsquo;s no way you could experience all of the options in a day. If you prefer open runs with a variety of terrain, the King Con Express is a 6-pack that leads to over 10 intermediate trail options. Just take the Eagle lift and head down Spiro to get to King Con. Many intermediate skiers will prefer the Canyons side of the mountain where you will be weaving through aspens left and right. Take the Red Pine Gondola to Chicane, a perfect warm-up run, and then grab the Tombstone Express lift and enjoy hours of great intermediate terrain.<br /><br /><strong>Advanced/Expert Terrain</strong> is also plentiful but those wanting the highest thrills will want to head to either Jupiter Peak (Mountain Village) or Murdock Peak (Canyons Village). Murdock involves two chair lifts to Super Condor Express, and from there you can hit the aspen-lined glad of A Chute or Funnel Cloud, or go find some powder in Condor Woods. Jupiter will take three lift rides to access and if you want to get to the summit you will have to skin up. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p><span>The Soldier Hollow Nordic Center\'s 1,200-foot sliding lanes are the longest tubing lanes in Utah. Its recently-upgraded conveyor lift system offers fast lifts and short lines. You can also enjoy tubing at night with fun lights and a built-in sound system.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Woodward Park City also offers recent upgrades, including the addition of a new magic carpet and an increased number of lanes for tubing. Two moving carpets make it easy for everyone in the family to enjoy the snow.</span></p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>There are over 70 kilometers of groomed trails in Park City and the surrounding mountains. Basin Recreation grooms 25 kilometers of free multipurpose trails connecting the Utah Olympic Park area with Willow Creek Park. Round Valley, located in Quinn\'s Junction, is a 25-kilometer trail network offering rolling hills and steep ascents. These free trails are multi-use and dog-friendly. White Pine Nordic Center offers 25 kilometers of fee-based groomed trails.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Things to Do at Park City</h2>\r\n<h3 > Park City Essentials</h3>\r\n<p>Only eight cities in the United States have hosted the Olympics, so make the most of your time in Park City and visit Utah Olympic Park.

Head here for pancakes, or maybe the Cristo Redentor, a french toast style ham and swiss cheese sandwich.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Lunch</h3>\r\n<p>Located at the bottom of Tombstone Express you can find <strong>Tombstone BBQ</strong>, an authentic joint smoking meats daily. With brisket, pulled pork, smoked wings and multiple beers on tap, it is a great spot to get refueled under the sun.</p>\r\n<p>If you happen to be at the village for lunch, you have to check out <strong>Main St. Deli &amp; Eatery</strong> and grab a gourmet sandwich or salad. A staple for more than 30 years, they know food and they have a strong reputation among locals.</p>\r\n<h3 > For Dinner</h3>\r\n<p>Short rib grilled cheese! If those words excite you at all, then you must go and visit <strong>Fletcher&rsquo;s</strong>. This top spot in Park City is a bit on the pricier side and is only open for dinner, so make a reservation and enjoy a great night of unique eats.</p>\r\n<p>For more of a traditional grill pub, <strong>No Name Saloon and Grill</strong> is a great option. The ambiance is great and they have buffalo burgers and a large drink menu. It is definitely one of Main Street&rsquo;s best.</p>'},

  'description': '<p>Park City Mountain Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine Ski Area</h3>\r\n<p><strong></strong>As the largest resort in the United States, there are trails for every type of skier and boarder. Due to the massive scale, it is recommended that you study the trail map and know which areas will lead to your best day on the mountain. There are two bases (Mountain Village and Canyons Village) and both lead to many runs for skiers and boarders of all levels. Some key tips are below based on skill level:<br /><br /><strong>Beginner Terrain</strong> is primarily found at the Park City Mountain Village, with Crescent Express, King Con Express, and Bonanza Express all taking you to a variety of beginner terrain. There is also a premier learning environment called High Meadow Park which is at Canyons Village, a dedicated learning area that features three Adventure Alleys which are perfect for learning to ski for the first time. While High Meadows Park is on the Canyons side of the mountain, note that there is little variety for beginners there outside of High Meadows Park. <br /><br /><strong>Intermediate Terrain</strong> is everywhere and there&rsquo;s no way you could experience all of the options in a day. If you prefer open runs with a variety of terrain, the King Con Express is a 6-pack that leads to over 10 intermediate trail options. Just take the Eagle lift and head down Spiro to get to King Con. Many intermediate skiers will prefer the Canyons side of the mountain where you will be weaving through aspens left and right. Take the Red Pine Gondola to Chicane, a perfect warm-up run, and then grab the Tombstone Express lift and enjoy hours of great intermediate terrain.<br /><br /><strong>Advanced/Expert Terrain</strong> is also plentiful but those wanting the highest thrills will want to head to either Jupiter Peak (Mountain Village) or Murdock Peak (Canyons Village). Murdock involves two chair lifts to Super Condor Express, and from there you can hit the aspen-lined glad of A Chute or Funnel Cloud, or go find some powder in Condor Woods. Jupiter will take three lift rides to access and if you want to get to the summit you will have to skin up. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing Park and Snow Play</h3>\r\n<p><span>The Soldier Hollow Nordic Center\'s 1,200-foot sliding lanes are the longest tubing lanes in Utah. Its recently-upgraded conveyor lift system offers fast lifts and short lines. You can also enjoy tubing at night with fun lights and a built-in sound system.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Woodward Park City also offers recent upgrades, including the addition of a new magic carpet and an increased number of lanes for tubing. Two moving carpets make it easy for everyone in the family to enjoy the snow.</span></p>\r\n<h3 > Cross-country Skiing and Snowshoeing</h3>\r\n<p>There are over 70 kilometers of groomed trails in Park City and the surrounding mountains. Basin Recreation grooms 25 kilometers of free multipurpose trails connecting the Utah Olympic Park area with Willow Creek Park. Round Valley, located in Quinn\'s Junction, is a 25-kilometer trail network offering rolling hills and steep ascents. These free trails are multi-use and dog-friendly. White Pine Nordic Center offers 25 kilometers of fee-based groomed trails.</p>'},

  'description': '<h2>Killington Ski Area</h2>\r\n<h3 > Alpine ski area</h3>\r\n<p>The mountain has five base areas, all of which work to start your day on the mountain.</p>\r\n<p>- <strong>Bear Mountain</strong> is the furthest south base area and has the most varied terrain of any base area. If you are traveling north on VT-100, this is the quickest way to get your day started, but is usually less crowded than Ramshead and Showshed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Ramshead Lodge&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Snowshed Lodge&nbsp;</strong>are both near each other on the north side of the area. If you are driving south on US-4, these will be the first base areas you\'ll hit. This is where you\'ll find all ski schools; the snowshed double and showshed express quad will take you to the largest set of runs devoted to beginners. If you want to hit the terrain park, Ramshead is where you\'ll find the Woodward Mountain Park.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<strong>Skyeship Lodge&nbsp;</strong>is a unique opportunity to avoid crowds. Located right on Route 4, it is a great place to park if you have all your gear ready to go. There are no rentals here, just a ticket window and a food court. Take the 3-mile Skyeship Express Gondola Stage I and then take Stage II, Needles or Northbrook Quad to your first runs. You\'ll save 10-15 minutes driving using this base.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Advanced skiers may want to start the day at&nbsp;<strong>K-1 Lodge.&nbsp;</strong>The K-1 express gondola takes you to Killington Peak, the summit of the ski area, where you can immediately find multiple double-black diamond runs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 > Tubing</h3>\r\n<p><span>The Killington Tubing Park is located at the Clubhouse on East Mountain Road across from the Killington Grand Resort Hotel and offers a multi-lane, lift-serviced good time for everyone. Note that the tubing park is normally only open Friday through Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span><br /></span></p>'},

Killington, however, has much more to offer. Killington Village is home to a wide selection of restaurants, bars and lodging options, along with some great nightlife and apr&egrave;s possibilities. Many hotels near Killington Ski Resort like The Killington Grand Hotel offers on-site activities, including a lounge by a firepit and different on-site restaurants.</p>\r\n<h3 > Non-skiing activities</h3>\r\n<p>The ski resort is also host to multiple activities other than skiing and snowboarding.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Beast Mountain Coaster</strong> is a 4,800-foot long alpine coaster that may seem tame at first with a long straight start, but once you start down it is full of great corskrew turns and amazing views. Note it is open only on Saturdays and Sundays in the winter.</p>\r\n<p>Who needs horses when you can jump on a <strong>Snowcat-drawn Sleigh</strong>? See the mountains in a unique light as you are drawn by a snowcat through the trails of Killington.</p>\r\n<p>Killington is also home to <strong>Snowmobile Vermont</strong>, the state\'s oldest and largest snowmobile tour company.

In 1937 on Thanksgiving morning, Pico Mountain Ski Resort came to life with only a 1,200 foot rope tow powered by a Hudson motor car engine and a lot of love. Since then, a lot has changed. But the love that began more than seventy years ago for this mountain still lives today &ndash; and it&rsquo;s as strong as ever. No other big mountain has such small mountain charm, and no athletes love their mountain quite like Pico skiers and riders.</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Families and skiing traditionalists now enjoy 52 trails serviced by seven lifts, including two high-speed detachable quads. Gentle learning terrain, smooth cruisers and classically narrow New England steeps can all be found at Pico Mountain. Even the most selective skiers and riders will be impressed by Pico&rsquo;s vertical drop of 1,967&rsquo; &ndash; taller than 80% of Vermont ski areas.</p>\r\n<p class="p1">Whether you choose scenic glades or gentle, winding trails, Pico Mountain has it all. And, if you&rsquo;re willing, we can teach you how to enjoy it all. Our Snow Sports School offers specialized learning programs for everyone from children and first-timers to seasoned pros, all created with quality and value in mind.</p>\r\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>'},

In fact, in the 1998 to 1999 season, the ski area recorded 1,140 inches of snow in a single season. The top elevation is 5,089 feet. The base elevation of White Salmon is 3,500 feet and 4,300 feet for Heather Meadows.

The breakout is 24% green, 45% blue and 31% black diamond. Mt. Baker does not have a terrain park. The season typically runs from late November until late April.</p>\r\n<p>Beginners are encouraged to take advantage of the two handle-tow surface lifts. Each mountain has one.

One visit to the ski concierge or an afternoon spent in the heated outdoor pool &ndash; where fur-clad Snow Angels deliver S&rsquo;mores and Icicles, a cocktail/dessert served in a freshly-made waffle cone -- and you&rsquo;ll be sold, though. The 11,600-square foot spa is a worthy reason to go for a half-day lift ticket. Each of the 16 treatment rooms has its own fireplace.

  'description': '<h3>Top-Rated Breakfast Spots</h3>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re staying in Jackson and driving out to the Village, a short detour to Nora&rsquo;s Fish Creek Innin Wilson at the base of Teton Pass is eminently worthwhile. In a cozy log cabin with a Tulikivi wood-burning stove, Nora&rsquo;s has everything from Banana Bread French Toast to a number of egg concoctions on the menu. There&rsquo;s usually a wait for a table - and everyone who walks in the door is subject to the same wait, even the occasional celebrity (David Letterman, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Harrison Ford) - but seats at the U-shaped bar turn over fairly quickly. 5600 Highway 22, Wilson, WY 83014</p>\r\n<h3>Best Lunch Restaurants</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>JHMR&rsquo;s on-mountain dining scene was one of the last things at the resort to go fancy.

You can&rsquo;t really go wrong with anything here, although expect prices to be a couple of dollars more than you&rsquo;d pay at a Thai place back home. 7342 Granite Loop Road, Teton Village, WY 83025</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Top Dinner Spots</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Il Villaggio Osteria (or just Osteria) inside Hotel Terra has a hip vibe.

  'description': "<h2>Jackson Hole Ski Conditions &amp; Terrain</h2>\r\n<p>Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (JHMR) tram stretches 4,139-feet from the base area to the 10,450-foot summit of Rendezvous Mountain. The Aerial Tram can hold 100 passengers and takes about 9 minutes to reach the top. There are plenty of signs that warn you to be careful when taking on these slopes. Even the most skilled skiers can find themselves in trouble around JHMR&rsquo;s 2,500 acres. The named runs are well marked though, so most often you have to go looking for trouble.</p>\r\n<h3>Terrain</h3>\r\n<p>Featuring two mountains, Apres Vous and Rendezvous, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort is known for steep skiing and gorgeous scenery, and is home to 2,500 acres of skiable terrain, 3,000 backcountry acres, 133 names trails on the ski map and 4,139 feet of vertical drop. The ski resort receives an average of 459 inches of snowfall each year and boasts a summit elevation of 10,450 feet. The Wyoming ski area may be notorious for extreme terrain like Corbet&rsquo;s Couloir, but Jackson Hole also caters to intermediate and beginner skiers with groomed terrain, which is accessed off the Teton Lift. Jackson Hole skiing difficulty ranges from beginner to advanced. In fact, 10% are green, 40% blue and 50% black runs.</p>\r\n<h3>Powder Day</h3>\r\n<p>People joke that a &ldquo;powder day&rdquo; at JHMR is more a &ldquo;powder hour.&rdquo; Locals here are hard-charging and can track out the area fast. In 1999, when JHMR opened the gates to lift-accessed backcountry, it was one of only a very few resorts to allow skiers and snowboarders to exit inbounds terrain. The Headwall and Casper Bowl are inbounds, but still require a 20-minute hike from the top of the Bridger Gondola. If hiking isn't your thing, Saratoga Bowl and Moran Woods, off Apres Vous and Casper, respectively, aren&rsquo;t as steep or as long as the Hobacks (off the Sublette Quad), but, because of that, do usually offer fresh tracks for longer. The trees to either side of Pepi&rsquo;s Ridge (Sublette Quad) can hold powder for a while, too. If you have the necessary backcountry gear - transceiver, shovel, probe - and skills, go ahead and aim for some true backcountry. Rock Springs and Cody Bowl, both just south of the resort boundaries and accessed through marked gates, are good starters, albeit fairly easy to get to, so fresh powder doesn&rsquo;t last long there. Backcountry runs in Granite Canyon, to the north of the resort in Grand Teton National Park and accessed from the top of the tram or the Apres Vous lift, are more committing. They require route finding skills or, better yet, someone who knows the area and is willing to let you follow them. Know that even though you don&rsquo;t need climbing skins to get out of Granite Canyon, they&rsquo;re never a bad thing to have in your backcountry pack in case you do get lost. The way back to the resort from Granite Canyon is a traverse, but not completely downhill. Expect to expend some serious energy before popping out near the bottom of the Apres Vous lift.</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers &amp; Family</h3>\r\n<p>Consider this fair warning: The ski area's only beginner terrain is off the Eagle&rsquo;s Rest double chair and the high-speed quad Teewinot lift next to the gondola in the base area. Together, the two lifts make for a nice learner&rsquo;s area. Once you&rsquo;re an intermediate skier, you have quite a few choices at JHMR. If you don&rsquo;t want to worry about having to pay particular attention to a ski trail map (and perhaps ending up above a cliff), Apres Vous Mountain is your best bet. The smaller and less cliffy of the resort&rsquo;s two mountains is serviced by a high-speed quad from the top of the Teewinot lift and, heading skier&rsquo;s right from the top of the lift, has an array of groomed intermediate runs stretching its entire face. The easiest intermediate runs on the mountain, which are still a big jump in difficulty for those coming from skiing the resort&rsquo;s green runs, are off the Casper Bowl Triple Chair. Easy Does It, Lift Line and Camp Ground are the most mellow runs off this lift. Horn&rsquo;s Hole Traverse to Amphitheater from the top of the high-speed quad Thunder Chair is another of the resort&rsquo;s more mellow intermediate runs. The Bridger Gondola accesses a lot of intermediate groomers, but they are substantially steeper than the runs mentioned off Casper and Thunder. Gondola intermediates are generally moderately steeper than the intermediate runs off the Apres Vous lift.</p>"},

  'description': '<p>Corbet&rsquo;s Couloir might be the resort&rsquo;s most famous run, but the fresh waffles topped with everything from Nutella to strawberries served up at Corbet&rsquo;s Cabin are worthy of some serious contemplation, too. Have one before heading over to Corbett&rsquo;s. The mandatory air to get into the famous Couloir is less intimidating on a full stomach.</p>\r\n<p>If the ski weather report has said that there&rsquo;s more snow at the top, it&rsquo;s best to stick to the higher runs than the lower elevations. You can access this terrain from the top of the tram. With lessons for all ages and abilities, JHMR Mountain Sports School is awesome. Adults signing up for group lessons at intermediate levels and higher often end up with a semi-private lesson.</p>\r\n<p>If you can tear yourself away from the mountain for a day off, Grand Teton National Park is literally right next to JHMR. Yellowstone National Park is about an hour away, and numerous outfitters in Jackson offer day-long snowmobile trips to Old Faithful, which is a much less touristy in winter.</p>\r\n<p>Few resorts in the country can compete with JHMR. Twelve miles away, Snow King Resort is smart enough not to try. Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;town hill,&rdquo; Snow King is still a local&rsquo;s favorite. It offers &frac12; day passes, 400 skiable acres, 32 named runs night skiing, a tubing park and, from both mid-mountain and the summit, fantastic views of the Tetons. It is north facing so usually pretty chilly. Back at JHMR, the best views of Corbet&rsquo;s Couloir - other than those heart-pounding looks you get standing at its lip - are from the southern deck at Couloir atop the Bridger Gondola.</p>'}],

You can&rsquo;t really go wrong with anything here, although expect prices to be a couple of dollars more than you&rsquo;d pay at a Thai place back home. 7342 Granite Loop Road, Teton Village, WY 83025</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Top Dinner Spots</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Il Villaggio Osteria (or just Osteria) inside Hotel Terra has a hip vibe. The pizzas, cooked to order in a wood-fired oven, are pretty close to perfect. 3335 West Village Drive, Teton Village, WY 83025</li>\r\n<li>Located between Teton Village and Jackson on the Moose Wilson Road, Q Roadhouse has the most sophisticated menu of any roadhouse we&rsquo;ve ever seen - and a great beer menu as well. 1224 Gregory Lane, Jackson, WY 83001</li>\r\n<li>In Jackson, locals love the casual option Snake River Brewery (aka &ldquo;the Brew Pub&rdquo;). The Brew Pub has at least seven of its award-winning beers on tap at all times and the portions of everything &ndash; but especially the pastas &ndash; are huge. 265 South Millward Street, Jackson, WY 83001</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Apres/NightLife</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Around since 1967, the Mangy Moose is the classic Teton Village apres ski scene. It qualifies as a Village institution at this point. While the 20-something ski bums like the Moose&rsquo;s cheap pitchers, vacationers appreciate the extensive top-shelf liquors, the skilled bartenders and the quality live music. 3295 Village Drive, Teton Village, WY 83025</li>\r\n<li>Families and those who prefer something more low-key might want to head to the Four Seasons Lounge instead. The soothing space can&rsquo;t help but relax.7680 Granite Loop Road, Teton Village, WY 83025</li>\r\n<li>In Wilson, the Stagecoach Bar has been a staple in the area since 1942. It has a great happy hour and is the place to go on a Sunday night. 5755 W, WY-22, Wilson, WY 83014</li>\r\n<li>Smack in the Town Square in Jackson under bright neon lights, you&rsquo;d never call The Million Dollar Cowboy Saloon a ski bar, but it is a classic valley watering hole and has live music a couple of times a week. It&rsquo;s also got some of the best people watching around: real and wanna-be cowboys mingle with co-eds, the occasionally Hollywood star and the valley&rsquo;s best western swing dancers. 25 North Cache Street, Jackson, WY 83001</li>\r\n</ul>'},

  'description': "<h2>Jackson Hole Ski Conditions &amp; Terrain</h2>\r\n<p>Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (JHMR) tram stretches 4,139-feet from the base area to the 10,450-foot summit of Rendezvous Mountain. The Aerial Tram can hold 100 passengers and takes about 9 minutes to reach the top. There are plenty of signs that warn you to be careful when taking on these slopes. Even the most skilled skiers can find themselves in trouble around JHMR&rsquo;s 2,500 acres. The named runs are well marked though, so most often you have to go looking for trouble.</p>\r\n<h3>Terrain</h3>\r\n<p>Featuring two mountains, Apres Vous and Rendezvous, Jackson Hole Mountain Resort is known for steep skiing and gorgeous scenery, and is home to 2,500 acres of skiable terrain, 3,000 backcountry acres, 133 names trails on the ski map and 4,139 feet of vertical drop. The ski resort receives an average of 459 inches of snowfall each year and boasts a summit elevation of 10,450 feet. The Wyoming ski area may be notorious for extreme terrain like Corbet&rsquo;s Couloir, but Jackson Hole also caters to intermediate and beginner skiers with groomed terrain, which is accessed off the Teton Lift. Jackson Hole skiing difficulty ranges from beginner to advanced. In fact, 10% are green, 40% blue and 50% black runs.</p>\r\n<h3>Powder Day</h3>\r\n<p>People joke that a &ldquo;powder day&rdquo; at JHMR is more a &ldquo;powder hour.&rdquo; Locals here are hard-charging and can track out the area fast. In 1999, when JHMR opened the gates to lift-accessed backcountry, it was one of only a very few resorts to allow skiers and snowboarders to exit inbounds terrain. The Headwall and Casper Bowl are inbounds, but still require a 20-minute hike from the top of the Bridger Gondola. If hiking isn't your thing, Saratoga Bowl and Moran Woods, off Apres Vous and Casper, respectively, aren&rsquo;t as steep or as long as the Hobacks (off the Sublette Quad), but, because of that, do usually offer fresh tracks for longer. The trees to either side of Pepi&rsquo;s Ridge (Sublette Quad) can hold powder for a while, too. If you have the necessary backcountry gear - transceiver, shovel, probe - and skills, go ahead and aim for some true backcountry. Rock Springs and Cody Bowl, both just south of the resort boundaries and accessed through marked gates, are good starters, albeit fairly easy to get to, so fresh powder doesn&rsquo;t last long there. Backcountry runs in Granite Canyon, to the north of the resort in Grand Teton National Park and accessed from the top of the tram or the Apres Vous lift, are more committing. They require route finding skills or, better yet, someone who knows the area and is willing to let you follow them. Know that even though you don&rsquo;t need climbing skins to get out of Granite Canyon, they&rsquo;re never a bad thing to have in your backcountry pack in case you do get lost. The way back to the resort from Granite Canyon is a traverse, but not completely downhill. Expect to expend some serious energy before popping out near the bottom of the Apres Vous lift.</p>\r\n<h3>Groomers &amp; Family</h3>\r\n<p>Consider this fair warning: The ski area's only beginner terrain is off the Eagle&rsquo;s Rest double chair and the high-speed quad Teewinot lift next to the gondola in the base area. Together, the two lifts make for a nice learner&rsquo;s area. Once you&rsquo;re an intermediate skier, you have quite a few choices at JHMR. If you don&rsquo;t want to worry about having to pay particular attention to a ski trail map (and perhaps ending up above a cliff), Apres Vous Mountain is your best bet. The smaller and less cliffy of the resort&rsquo;s two mountains is serviced by a high-speed quad from the top of the Teewinot lift and, heading skier&rsquo;s right from the top of the lift, has an array of groomed intermediate runs stretching its entire face. The easiest intermediate runs on the mountain, which are still a big jump in difficulty for those coming from skiing the resort&rsquo;s green runs, are off the Casper Bowl Triple Chair. Easy Does It, Lift Line and Camp Ground are the most mellow runs off this lift. Horn&rsquo;s Hole Traverse to Amphitheater from the top of the high-speed quad Thunder Chair is another of the resort&rsquo;s more mellow intermediate runs. The Bridger Gondola accesses a lot of intermediate groomers, but they are substantially steeper than the runs mentioned off Casper and Thunder. Gondola intermediates are generally moderately steeper than the intermediate runs off the Apres Vous lift.</p>"},

  'description': '<p>Corbet&rsquo;s Couloir might be the resort&rsquo;s most famous run, but the fresh waffles topped with everything from Nutella to strawberries served up at Corbet&rsquo;s Cabin are worthy of some serious contemplation, too. Have one before heading over to Corbett&rsquo;s. The mandatory air to get into the famous Couloir is less intimidating on a full stomach.</p>\r\n<p>If the ski weather report has said that there&rsquo;s more snow at the top, it&rsquo;s best to stick to the higher runs than the lower elevations. You can access this terrain from the top of the tram. With lessons for all ages and abilities, JHMR Mountain Sports School is awesome. Adults signing up for group lessons at intermediate levels and higher often end up with a semi-private lesson.</p>\r\n<p>If you can tear yourself away from the mountain for a day off, Grand Teton National Park is literally right next to JHMR. Yellowstone National Park is about an hour away, and numerous outfitters in Jackson offer day-long snowmobile trips to Old Faithful, which is a much less touristy in winter.</p>\r\n<p>Few resorts in the country can compete with JHMR. Twelve miles away, Snow King Resort is smart enough not to try. Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;town hill,&rdquo; Snow King is still a local&rsquo;s favorite. It offers &frac12; day passes, 400 skiable acres, 32 named runs night skiing, a tubing park and, from both mid-mountain and the summit, fantastic views of the Tetons. It is north facing so usually pretty chilly. Back at JHMR, the best views of Corbet&rsquo;s Couloir - other than those heart-pounding looks you get standing at its lip - are from the southern deck at Couloir atop the Bridger Gondola.</p>'}],
