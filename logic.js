Tukino is a great destination for families, expert skiers and snowboarders alike.\r\nTukino is open to the public for skiing and riding and also offers cat-skiing, ski-touring and ice climbing. The ski field is sheltered from the westerly winds and often operates in the clear while the rest of Mt. Ruapehu is covered in clouds. Visit Tukino to experience an on-mountain atmosphere reminiscent of what resorts used to be like. ",

The ski area is enormous with over 5,289 acres to explore and four distinct base areas connected by free buses and heated walkways. It draws skiers from all over the world and provides excellent terrain for all ability levels.\r\nThe resort has great terrain options, excellent ski schools and a large assortment of shopping and dining options. The two main base areas are Vail Village and Lionshead. Vail Village located at the base of Gondola One is the original base area and is home to Vail&rsquo;s iconic covered bridge that crosses Gore Creek. Lionshead Village, located just west of Vail Village, is serviced by its own gondola and is home to luxury resorts.\r\nDenver to Vail is about 1.5 hours &ndash; or more depending on traffic. It is 100 miles from Denver International Airport and 30 miles east of Eagle County Regional Airport (EGE). There are plenty of shuttle services to Vail. Once you get to Vail, you can navigate the town by bus for free.\r\nVail is a great destination for many skiers, but the resort can get crowded on the weekends. So, check the chair lift status signs at strategic intersections on the mountain to avoid backups. A yellow light means the lift maze is full so choose an alternative route if possible. A green light means you are good to go.&nbsp;\r\nVail Ski Resort History\r\nWhile many other ski resorts in the western United States started as mining towns, Vail was built from the ground up to be a ski resort. During World War II the U.S. Army established a training center at Camp Hale located just 14 miles south of what would later become Vail Mountain. The U.S. Army&rsquo;s 10th&nbsp;Mountain Division trained at Camp Hale and consisted of excellent skiers and mountaineers that fought in the mountains of northern Italy during WWII. Upon their return from the war, they quickly became major players in the burgeoning ski industry.\r\nA veteran of the 10th&nbsp;Mountain Division, Pete Seibert returned to Colorado after the war to search for a perfect location to build a ski area in the Rocky Mountain region. Pete teamed up with friend Earl Eaton who led Pete on a seven-hour climb up a no-name mountain, where they crested the summit to discover the now legendary back bowls.\r\n",

It's all natural here.\r\nYou'll find what you are looking for, regardless of your ability. Do your skiing or riding thing across 3,000 acres from groomed cruisers to the Putnam Creek steeps and into the Silver Woods glades.\r\nSilver Star&rsquo;s village is reminiscent of a typical 19th century British Columbian mining town era with Victorian architecture. Boarded sidewalks and brightly colored shop fronts add a unique western flavor.\r\nAccommodations are ski-in, ski-out with condos and hotels. The Snowbird Lodge is luxurious and you also can enjoy some unique Victorian-style vacation homes.\r\nSilver Star averages more than 700 cm of snow annually (23 feet). There are 12 lifts, including a six-pack, four quads, a double, four surface lifts and two tube lifts. You'll ski or ride on 115 marked trails, the majority intermediate, but with plenty of beginner and advanced action.\r\nEnjoy cross-country skiing? Well, members of numerous national teams, including Canada and the U.S., will tell you Big White's Nordic trails are among their favorites.\r\nThe resort is 22 km (12 miles) from Vernon. Easiest bet from there is to take the Vernon Airporter to the mountain. Driving? Connect with Highway 97 to Vernon and follow 48th Ave. to Silver Star Road directly to the resort.

  "name":"Alpe d'Huez",
    "description":"Alpe d&rsquo;Huez&nbsp;(1,860-3330m) is a sizeable, modern resort known for its sunny, extensive terrain and spectacular views across the Southern Alps. The efficient lift system whisks you up to the vast, high-altitude ski area of the Alpe d&rsquo;Huez Grand Domain Ski (250km) with its wide choice of varied runs, well-suited to all levels.\r\nAlpe d&rsquo;Huez is one of the liveliest resorts in the French Alps, but is divided into separate quarters, so you can often find yourself far away from the centre (Avenue des Jeux). A good tip is to stay in the prettier, more rustic village of Vaujany, which is linked to Alpe d&rsquo;Huez by chairlift. Families are particularly fond of Alpe d&rsquo;Huez for its friendly, laid-back atmosphere and wide choice of accommodation &ndash; apartments, chalets, hotels and B&amp;Bs.\r\nThe ski area is comprised of five ski resorts and two traditional mountain villages: Alpe d&rsquo;Huez, Auris-en-Oisans, La Garde, Le Freney d&rsquo;Oisans, Oz-en-Oisans, Vaujany and Villard-Reculas.\r\nThe Mountain\r\nThe resort&rsquo;s efficient lift system whisks skiers up to the vast, high-altitude slopes of the&nbsp;Alpe d&rsquo;Huez Grand Domaine Ski&nbsp;(250km). Here you&rsquo;ll find a wealth of sunny, south-facing runs high above the treeline, suitable for all levels and dotted with plenty of good mountain restaurants.\r\nFew resorts can rival Alpe d&rsquo;Huez for size of ski area and variety of terrain, which is often compared to Espace Killy (Tignes and Val d&rsquo;Isere). In mid-winter Alpe d&rsquo;Huez&rsquo;s high-altitude slopes maintain great snow conditions, but the strong southern sun can mean late-season snow becomes slushy in the afternoon.\r\nMountain highlights include the 16km Sarenne piste (primarily black) which offers 1hr30 of uninterrupted skiing. There&rsquo;s also some serious off-piste, plenty of steep verticals, a varied snow park and one of the biggest nursery ski areas in the Alps.\r\nDownsides to the ski area are the few tree runs, which leaves few options on bad-weather days; &nbsp;overcrowding is a regular occurrence on the Chamois and Coulior runs at the top of the DMC gondola; and late-season snow can alternate between slushy afternoons and icy mornings.\r\nFreeriding\r\nAlpe d&rsquo;Huez has some serious off-piste to explore. The extensive and varied terrain is particularly well-suited to the more adventurous freerider. You&rsquo;ll find more than 20 high-altitude, off-piste trails, with gullies and tracts of fresh powdered snow. &nbsp;Some of the most popular off-piste powder can be found in areas such as&nbsp;Gorges de Sarenne&nbsp;and&nbsp;Glacier de Sarenne. Note: Always ride with a guide.\r\nOn the pistes\r\nBeginners: Alpe d&rsquo;Huez has one of the largest nursery areas in the Alps with four free lifts for beginners. The mass of green runs above the village (accessed by the Troncon cable car) and above the Les Bergers area (accessed by the Romains chair) offer plenty of wide, gentle slopes to help you find your snow legs. Although watch out for more advanced skiers whizzing through at the end of the day.\r\nIntermediates:&nbsp;A good selection of intermediate runs are spread throughout the ski area. Some of the most challenging reds can be found in the&nbsp;Villard-Reculas&nbsp;and&nbsp;Signal de l&rsquo;Homme&nbsp;sectors. Confident intermediates can try the&nbsp;Canyon&nbsp;run&nbsp;from Plat des Marmottes or the 16km&nbsp;Sarenne&nbsp;black run. For less confident intermediates, there are some great blue cruisers from the Signal sector heading down to Alpe d&rsquo;Huez, or try the sector the long, blue&nbsp;Champclotury run&nbsp;above Oz or the main&nbsp;Couloir blue&nbsp;from 2,700m.\r\nAdvanced/experts:&nbsp;The black, expert runs are accessible from the top of&nbsp;Pic Blanc&nbsp;and&nbsp;Les Marmottes III&nbsp;cable car. They attract thrill seekers and the more technically advanced skiers to experience the maximum vertical drop of 2,200m.&nbsp;Particularly noteworthy black runs include the&nbsp;Fare&nbsp;piste, the&nbsp;Combe Charbonniere,&nbsp;Balme,&nbsp;La Fuma&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Col de Cluy.\r\nThe legendary&nbsp;16km&nbsp;black&nbsp;Sarenne piste&nbsp;stretches from Pic Blanc (3,330m) to Alpe d'Huez (1,860m). It&nbsp;consists of two sections: initially a fairly steep series of pitches which can get a bit mogulled and then a long flatter section along the valley. It is primarily a black ski run, but you can avoid the really steep section at the top by skiing off from the&nbsp;Marmottes 3 bubble instead. On a powder day, the run can take quite some time with waist-deep snow to wade through in the flatter section.\r\nPark/Pipe\r\nAlpe d&rsquo;Huez has two snowparks: the main (advanced) one, stretching down the side of the DMC, is praised for its design. You&rsquo;ll find everything from an easy beginner line to a big airbag jump, half-pipe (depending on snow conditions), a boardercross, and multitude of rails; the second, smaller park is for beginners (with a couple of kickers and some bumps) and is located above Vaujany.",

  "name":"Alpe du Grand Serre",
    "description":"At the entrance to the Oisans area of the Alps, you will find the ski resort of Alpe du Grand Serre. Perched on top of the 1368 metre high mountain pass leading from the Romanche to the Roizonne Valley, the town is over looked by the massive Taillefer and Grand Serre mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThe ski resort is made up of 6 hamlets (Désert, la Blache, Chabottel, La Cascade, Le Couvent and Jean-Poncet), 150 permanent inhabitants and nearly 700 holiday homes. To find the bottom of the slopes, the ticket desks and a good range of shops go to La Blache.\r\n\r\nA far cry from the crowded skiing of the larger resorts, Alpe du Grand Serre has it all with high altitude skiing offering 55 kilometres of marked ski slopes and an undulating wooded area with 20 kilometres of cross-country skiing tracks.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the Alpe du Grand Serre ski resort is invisible from the town itself and the lift and ski run network is well spread out amongst the Pérollier mountain range which rises up to 2184 metres in altitude. The 817 metres of vertical descent back to the resort (1367 m) is indeed an important factor in providing an overall pleasurable skiing experience, but it is ultimately the layout of the resort network itself that really makes the Alpe du Grand Serre stand out.\r\n\r\nThe ski runs are positioned around the peak of the Pérollier, offering skiing on each side of the mountain. This relatively unique set up in Europe allows the skier to choose their ski routes according to the sun throughout the day or the quality of the snow.\r\n\r\nThe ski area of the Alpe du Grand Serre is made up of a large majority of blue and red runs. The skiing is great for intermediate skiers looking to improve their technique, but also highly accessible to families of all kinds. It is also worth noting that there are two specially set-up areas at the bottom of La Blache which are great for children learning to ski.\r\n\r\nThe bonus: take a trip to the resorts of Oz en Oisans and Vaujany located in the Alpe d’Heuz ski area which are only 50 minutes away by car. If you are skiing at the Alpe du Grand Serre for at least 3 days, you can enjoy from the ski pass exchange program that the two ski areas have put in place.\r\n\r\nA mountain holiday doesn’t necessarily mean skiing and snowboarding; for those that prefer something a little different you can sure to enjoy yourself just as much on snowshoes, tobogganing or simply a walking through this beautiful setting with those who you love. \r\n\r\nThe ‘Club des intrépides’ welcomes children between 6 and 11 years old who have accomplished either their 2nd or 3rd level ski star. The team helps kids to gradually master skiing and ultimately prime them for eventual ski racing. The children are able to participate in group ski activities including basic slalom and as well as a chance to discover snowboarding.\r\n\r\nFor younger children, the nursery \"Les Bout'Choux\" welcomes children from 6 months to 6 years old throughout the winter season from 9am to 5pm every day (except Thursdays outside of the holiday periods). The nursery welcomes babies and organises themed activities such as fun in the snow, Eskimos, natural discovery, scientific discovery and outdoor games. The nursery works in partnership with the ESF (French Ski School) to offer ski lessons in the ‘Piou-Piou’ (Piwi-Piwi) Club.",

  "name":"Areches Beaufort",
    "description":"At the heart of Beaufortain area of the Savoie, 25 km from Albertville, Arêches-Beaufort is a charming traditional ski village with a range of ski runs meandering through the forests that pass beside the beautiful wooden chalets, overlooked by the Mont Blanc. The resort also has plenty of natural ski areas for those budding off piste powder skiing enthusiasts. \r\n\r\nThe resort town of Arêches Beaufort is divided into two sectors: Le Grand Mont and Le Planay.\r\n\r\nThe resort offers exceptional snow fall covering the slopes which stretch from 1080 metres to 2300 metres in altitude. Arêches-Beaufort is a resort that should be considered by skiers of all abilities (55 km of ski runs). What with the Freestyle Snow Park, the Woodpark through to the Boarder Baby Cross and the large areas dedicated to free riding, there is definitely something for everyone! \r\n\r\nArêches-Beaufort doesn't leave out the Nordic skiers either. The cross country ski trails are spread over 3 sites: \r\n- Marcot-Beaufort: Easy skiing, on the edge of the Marcot forest. Skiing through the forest is a great way to get away from it all, and if you are just beginning the resort has flat trails, ideal for those just starting out. \r\n- Le Bersend: Don't leave without trying the easy cross country skiing trails in Le Bersend! The trails take skiers through the typical unspoiled alpine mountain villages and if you're lucky you'll have the chance to see some of the rich and varied local wildlife: deer, chamois, foxes, weasels to name but a few... \r\n- The plateau-Cuvy: At 1700 m high there is a 2 km long cross country ski trail (chairlift access from the Grand-Mont). \r\n\r\nFor those who choose to spend their holidays in Arêches Beaufort who don't necessarily ski, the resort offers a wide range of activities: snowshoe races, snow or ice races, horse and carriage rides, historical discovery (churches, Baroque trails ...), farm visits (cheese and wine shops produce the famous Beaufort cheese). \r\n\r\nIn Arêches Beaufort there are plenty of people willing to look after your children when you're off skiing: \r\n- Daycare \"Les Petites Frimousses\" in Planay (welcomes children from 18 months to 6 years old) \r\n- The nursery \"Galipette\" in Beaufort (12 places from 3 months to 6 years old)\r\n \r\nYou can also call the childminders who are certified by the Savoie department (about a dozen is the Arêches Beaufort ski resort).\r\n\r\nThe snow garden for children from 3 to 5 years old is a great place for young apprentice skiers to find their feet, making use of the specially designed easy access mini ski lift. The welcoming team offer a range of ski related games and supervised activities great for keeping the kids occupied throughout the day. \r\n\r\nArêches-Beaufort is well set up for children and offers a public snow garden (original Arêches-Beaufort concept) which is on the Plateau of Cuvy and accessed by the Grand Mont chairlift (open to pedestrians). The snow garden offers families with young children a place to play in safety whilst being outside and taking in the fabulous views. \r\n\r\nIn Arêches-Beaufort the real food connoisseurs will enjoy the local cuisine, the famous Beaufort cheese, the Grataron (goat cheese), the Pormonier (pork and vegetable sausage) or the Farçon (a dessert made with potatoes, prunes, figs and spices). These traditional local dishes are served in an array of restaurants found in the resort. ",

  "name":"Avoriaz",
    "description":"AVORIAZ&nbsp;is best for: Families, intermediates, freestylers\r\nHighlights: Car-free, sunny village with compact centre, ski-in/ski-out lodgings, shady snowsure slopes, great position on the Portes du Soleil circuit, leading resort for freestylers (five terrain parks and a super-pipe), plenty of good off-piste, access to the legendary Swiss Wall, and a renowned kids' club.\r\nNon-skiers:&nbsp;Aquariaz&nbsp;leisure pool, bowling, skating rink, dog sledding, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.\r\nNearest airports: Geneva (100km/1hr30), Chambery (145km/1hr50), Lyon (220km/2hr30).&nbsp;Nearest station:&nbsp;Cluses and Thonon-les-bains are both around 1 hour away by road\r\nSix-day ski pass: &euro;260\r\nOverview\r\nSlap bang in the centre of the&nbsp;Portes du Soleil&nbsp;ski area, Avoriaz (1,800m) has access to some serious terrain &ndash;&nbsp;650km to be exact. The local ski area ain't too shabby either with fast, modern lifts and high, snow-sure slopes receiving around eight metres of powder each winter.&nbsp;Avoriaz is also one of the French greats for freestylers &ndash; there are now five snowparks and a super-pipe.\r\nArchitecturally, Avoriaz is one of the more modern resorts in the Portes du Soleil but, in contrast, transportation around town is delightfully old fashioned. It is one of the few pedestrianized resorts in the Alps so you won't see any cars here;&nbsp;sleds, snowcats or horse-drawn sleighs are the only form of transport allowed, and skis of course &ndash; the resort&rsquo;s high-altitude means skiing back to your hotel is the norm. Avoriaz has a very narrow selection of hotels and restaurants, but just a lift ride away (with more choice) is the British favourite, Morzine.\r\nThe Mountain\r\nAvoriaz: 75.5km local slopes (650km Portes du Soleil)\r\nThe&nbsp;Portes du Soleil&nbsp;is one of the largest ski areas in the world, comprising&nbsp;650km&nbsp;of slopes and 12 resorts. With a vast and varied choice of ski runs, the area offers endless possibilities, allowing you to cross the border into Switzerland.\r\nIn the heart of the Portes du Soleil sits Avoriaz &ndash; the highest resort in the area with the best snow conditions; its local ski slopes receive, on average, eight metres of powder each winter. The resort has lifts and pistes fanning out in all directions. Its closest slopes can appear a little bleak and tree-less, but they are fairly snow-sure and are served by fast, modern lifts. If you&rsquo;re heading out further afield, be warned the lifts beyond Chatel are outdated and slow.\r\nThere&rsquo;s plenty to satisfy all skiers in Avoriaz: long, gentle cruisers and highly acclaimed ski schools for families; five snowparks and a superpipe for freestylers; and the terrifying Swiss Wall, Olympic downhill and fast, technical off-piste routes for experts.\r\nThere are&nbsp;three&nbsp;off-piste&nbsp;runs that should not be missed on powder day:&nbsp;Vall&eacute;e de la manche&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a 10km descent with dramatic views of the Mont Blanc;&nbsp;La Pointe de Vorlaz&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a very fast and technical run; and the&nbsp;Swiss side of&nbsp;Mossette&nbsp;which starts with a narrow passage before opening into a large plateau and canyon.&nbsp;\r\nAlternatively, for a less risky off-piste experience, all ski levels can enjoy the&nbsp;snowcross zones&nbsp;which offer all the thrills of unpisted slopes in a safe, patrolled setting: the black&nbsp;snowcross zones&nbsp;of Crozats and La Frontaliere;&nbsp;red snowcross zones of Les Brouchaux and Pschott; and the blue La Combe des Marmottes snowcross &ndash; a playful area of small undulations, ideal for families.\r\nOn the pistes\r\nExpert/Advanced:&nbsp;Expert skiers should make their first port of call the infamous&nbsp;Swiss Wall. Early risers will often find powder conditions, making it not nearly as terrifying, but leave it too late in the day and the Wall turns into a seriously steep icy mogul field. Take the lifts up to the Chavanette sector and beyond the Swiss border lies the Wall. Before entering the Wall, you pass the \"For Experts Only\" sign. After you've completed the first six turns and rounded an overhang, the Wall reveals itself as a steep 200-metre slope. Do not try to attempt the wall in icy conditions &ndash; it can be fatal.\r\nWhen your legs have stopped wobbling from conquering the Wall, take the Grandes Combes lift up to 2,400m to reach the long, steep black runs down to&nbsp;Les Prodains&nbsp;&ndash; the most demanding in Avoriaz, and featuring an&nbsp;Olympic downhill.\r\nAdvanced skiers have a huge concentration of long reds, winding through the trees, between Les Lindarets and Chatel.\r\nIntermediates:&nbsp;Gain confidence on the three long, gentle blue runs from the top of the Grandes Combes. Other options include taking the&nbsp;Chavanette&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fornet&nbsp;lifts to cruise some seriously long blues or exploring the pretty, tree-lined routes leading down to&nbsp;Les Lindarets&nbsp;and&nbsp;Chatel. There&rsquo;s plenty of gentle intermediate terrain above Champery in the&nbsp;Planachaux&nbsp;area. From here you can also reach the large open skiing around&nbsp;Champoussin&nbsp;and&nbsp;Les Crosets.\r\nBeginners: Enrol in the&nbsp;Avoriaz Alpine Ski School&nbsp;staffed with British instructors while children aged from 3 years spend a full day&rsquo;s skiing (with lunch and tea) at the&nbsp;Village des Enfants. After a confidence-building ski lesson in the morning, head out onto the sunny green and blue slopes right next to town to practice your turns. The blue snowcross,&nbsp;La Combe des Marmottes, is an unpisted, but patrolled zone offering a playful area of small undulations, ideal for families.\r\nPark/Pipe\r\nThe half-pipe has been transformed into a&nbsp;Super-Pipe, now 120-metres-long and six metres high.\r\nThe well-maintained&nbsp;Arare Snowpark, which can be accessed from Grandes Combes, is billed as &ldquo;the real snowpark for freestylers&rdquo; and is for advanced to expert skiers only. It features kicker and rail lines as well as an airbag jump. Next to the Arare Snowpark is the boardercross: &lsquo;blue&rsquo; to warm up and &lsquo;red&rsquo; to really challenge your skills.\r\nLa Chapelle&nbsp;snowpark is ideal for beginners and intermediates with its jumps of all sizes. It has been designed to meet the needs of both skiers and snowboarders and features different obstacles (boardercross, jumps and woops).\r\nIntermediates can also hit&nbsp;The Stash, with its wooden and natural elements. Kids have their own mini snowparks at&nbsp;Parkway&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lil&rsquo;Stash.",

  "name":"Chamonix",
    "description":"Chamonix is&nbsp;the&nbsp;place to go for alpine thrill seekers wanting to push themselves to the extreme. The resort is known the world over for its steep, challenging runs, off-piste powder, and dramatic mountain scenery. Its legendary 20-kilometre (12-mile) Valley Blanche is a high off-piste run, the longest in Europe, and a rite of passage for ballsy skiers on their way to becoming experts. Chamonix hosted the first ever Winter Olympics in 1924 and is considered by many to be the birthplace of alpine skiing. The resort is a large, yet attractive town offering both traditional charm and a lively nightlife.\r\nChamonix ski resort is located a little over an hour form Geneva, one and half hours from Chambery, two hours from Turin and a little over two hours from Lyon. All these locations are serviced by major airlines. From these hubs, you can rent a car or take an airport transfer. Trains also move in between most of these locations.\r\nThe MountainChamonix's ski area (1,035-3,842m) is spread across five mountains:&nbsp;Grands Montets, L'Aiguille du Midi,&nbsp;Le Br&eacute;vent&nbsp;and&nbsp;La Fl&eacute;g&egrave;re&nbsp;(lift linked) and&nbsp;Le Tour, so skiers must be prepared to travel if they want to ski multiple areas. The good news is that recent lift upgrades mean shorter queuing times.Chamonix is one of the giants for freeriding. The&nbsp;Aiguille du Midi&nbsp;and&nbsp;Grands Montets&nbsp;cable cars offer access to the off-piste powder on the glaciers.&nbsp;Freeriders will encounter some mind-blowing scenery along the way&nbsp;-&nbsp;deep crevasses, ice falls, clifftops, and caves.From the Aiguille du Midi (3,812m) you can see the French, Swiss and Italian Alps (including Mont Blanc on a clear day). This is the view just before skiing down the 20-kilometre Valley Blanche - a totally unmarked and unmaintained off-piste run.Freestylers describe Chamonix as one big playground with an abundance of natural freestyle terrain. There are also two snowparks and a half-pipe.Beginners and intermediates aren't left out in the cold; there are plenty of long green, blue, and red runs with reliable snowcover on which to practise turns.Chamonix makes up part of the&nbsp;Mont Blanc&nbsp;ski area. There are two ski passes to choose from:&nbsp;Chamonix Pass&nbsp;(&euro;237/week) or the&nbsp;Mont Blanc Pass&nbsp;(&euro;289/week).Powder DayChamonix's popularity means its runs tend to&nbsp;get tracked out by lunchtime, so advanced skiers should head to the high off-piste terrain to avoid the crowds (take the&nbsp;Aiguille du Midi&nbsp;or&nbsp;Grands Montets&nbsp;cable cars). There are many dangers not least from crevasses, seracs, cliffs and avalanches so it's worth getting a handful of friends together and hiring a guide for the day; a guide will not only ensure safety but will show you some of the mountain's hidden gems.&nbsp;Evolution 2, Intersport shop, 306 Rue dr Paccard, Chamonix (+33(0)450 559 022) charges &euro;80 per person to accompany an experienced guide off-piste for the day (groups of four to eight).The one thing all powder enthusiasts seek is the run that keeps going for miles and Chamonix has plenty of those. The 20-kilometre (12-mile)&nbsp;Valley Blanche&nbsp;is the obvious place to head to. Accessed by the Aiguille du Midi cable car (3812m), The VB has a 2800-metre vertical and some very real dangers; only skiers able to parallel turn on a red run should attempt it (a guide is strongly recommended). There are several variants of the run: the&nbsp;Normal Valley, the&nbsp;Petit Envers du Plan&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Grand Envers du Plan; the latter two are more visually interesting, but are more heavily crevassed and hold a higher risk of avalanches. The VB is best skiied in Feburary/March time (don't leave it too late in the day for safety reasons).Besides the Valley Blanche, check out the powder on the&nbsp;Lavencher bowl&nbsp;accessed by the Bochard lift. The extreme freeride race,&nbsp;Red Bull Snowthrill, is hosted here each February.Heli-skiing&nbsp;is another option; many companies offer heli-drops on the Mont-Blanc massif just over the border in Switzerland or Italy (heli-drops are illegal on French National parkland). Evolution 2 runs heliskiing trips to the Val Veny in Italy, 20 minutes from the centre of Chamonix, costing &euro;350 per person (see above for contact details).Beginners/IntermediatesFirst-timers/Children: Chamonix has four nursery areas:&nbsp;Les Planards,&nbsp;Les Chosalets,&nbsp;Le Savoy, and&nbsp;La Vormaine, all of which are covered by the Chamonix Pass. Ski kindergartens operate in Le Savoy (1049m) and La Vormaine (1480m). The&nbsp;Chamonix Ski School, 190 Place de l'Eglise (+33(0)450 532 257)&nbsp;take children from three years. The&nbsp;Paradis des Praz&nbsp;children's ski park (+33(0)661 732 300), located behind the golf course in Les Praz, is open Wednesdays, weekends, and school holidays and is popular for its snow rafting; &euro;2,50 for 20 minutes.Beginners: The only complaint about Chamonix's beginner ski areas is that they're a little fragmented from the rest, but there is a good choice.&nbsp;Les Chosalets&nbsp;(1,230m) is 500 metres from the Lognan/Grands Montets cable car in Argentiere and ideal for beginners of all ages.&nbsp;Les Planards&nbsp;(1,062-1,242m) is a large ski area for both beginners and intermediates with four runs (one red, one blue, two green) and a mountain restaurant; snow cover here is guarenteed with 41 canons.Intermediates: There is a good choice of long blue and red runs to practise turns, particularly in&nbsp;La Flegere&nbsp;and&nbsp;Les Houches. The disadvantage of Les Houches is that it's not covered by the Chamonix Pass and it is also littered with drag lifts. The higher slopes of&nbsp;Les Grands Montets&nbsp;(2,765m) offer long, wide runs as well as steeper, more challening terrain to test your skills as your confidence improves later in the week.FreestylersChamonix has two snowparks: one in Les Grands Montets and the other in Les Houches.&nbsp;Les Grands Montets Snowpark&nbsp;is located at the mid-station of Lognan. Freestylers of all levels are welcome: the Fun Zone is ideal for beginners with its practise area of gentle jumps; the Snow Bowl attracts the more advanced for its table-top jumps, big kickers, and banked turns. Most years there's also a natural half-pipe.Les Houches'&nbsp;Area 43&nbsp;is a mobile park unit - basically a container dropped into place by a helicopter (like the one in Kitzbuehel) featuring boxes, rails, and tables. Although smaller than Les Grands Montets Snowpark, more modules are expected to be added to the park over time.Freestylers don't have to limit themselves to the snowparks: Chamonix has an abundance of&nbsp;natural freestyle terrain, such as jumps, quarter-pipes, and gullies, particularly in Le Tour and La Flegere. The latter is also home to the popular Big Tit Jump, which is the largest natural kicker in Europe.\r\n&nbsp;",

Whether you're interested in food and wine or downhill skiing there is something for everyone. The downhill skiing on offer is well exposed to the weather and receives a good snow covering throughout the winter season. The varied cross-country skiing allows the less daring to explore the mountain range, skiing through the dabbled light of the larch forests of the Southern Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Ancelle ski resort, built at 1350 metres high, prides itself on its wonderful views, its array of activities on offer and of cause a good quality of snow that satisfies skiers and snowboarders of all abilities.\r\nThe entire area (excluding Costebelle-Moissière and the ‘Piste B') is covered by a comprehensive snowmaking system that ensures a sufficient snow cover throughout the winter.\r\nAt the bottom of the slopes, visitors can ski down to a choice of friendly sun soaked terraces. For kids and adults alike there is a popular area set aside for tobogganing right at the bottom of the ski lifts!\r\n\r\nFor those ‘Nu Skool' Skiers and snowboarders the resort and association of Ancelle Polemik have built a great snow park and a boarder cross track since 2006. The freestyle area is highly accessible, with a range of jumps, rails and features for all abilities. At the bottom of the ski slopes visitors will find the \"Polemik” Park. The Snow Park is made up of many different obstacles, a kid's area with music, a picnic table and a barbecue. A great place to hone your skills, to learn to “freestyle” or just enjoy the good humour that is always in the air!\r\n\r\nThanks to its unique location, nestled in middle of an open plateau exposed to a large amount of snow, Ancelle is also well suited to traditional Nordic activities. You can choose between 4 cross country ski loops for all abilities and fitness levels (from 3.5 to 10 km). There are also many other places to go walking. The ski resort links to 8 other ski villages and in total has about 200 km of trails that allow visitors to get around the mountain range relatively easily.\r\n\r\nAccommodation in Ancelle is well varied (hotels, lodges, charming bed and breakfasts, campsites, furnished apartments, etc...) and has all the traditional mountain resort facilities easily accessible.\r\n \r\nWith an ESF (French Ski School) and a Snow Kindergarten, Ancelle is able to accommodate all the family. After a busy day, what could be nicer than a stroll in the village for a warm crepe (French pancakes) or the discovery of Ancelle's unique high-alpine architecture.",

  "name":"La Grave la Meije",
    "description":"The Meije Glacier cable car opens the doors to a ski area which is not actually a ski area. This magical skiing landmark is one of the world's last true holy grails in which skiers can be free and truly live by their passion. In La Grave there are endless routes down the series of small valleys, for the most daring, those of the Meije, and for those searching a little safety those of Chancel.\r\n\r\nBetween the 3600 metre high Dome Lauze (the top of the resort) and the 1500 metre base in the village, Romanche, there are no marked ski runs, everyone can choose their own line, where to make their mark. Each person can make their own unique pattern in the La Grave snow. Internationally renowned, the valleys of Meije gather, each year, passionate skiers and snowboarders from all over the world. This is Europe's mecca for freeride skiing.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the valley, there is a whole different atmosphere ... Two resort villages; Le Chazelet and Villar d'Arène both welcome skiers of all abilities. These towns offer skiing in a quiet, peaceful and idyllic setting, far from the overcrowded, purpose built ski resorts. The prices of the ski passes are competitive and the slopes are great for young novices, or just if you're out to have some fun.\r\n\r\nIn winter La Grave is also the meeting place for experienced ice climbers. The valley is transformed into an ice palace, counting nearly 130 waterfalls for all different ability levels. With their crampons and ice axes strapped-on, ice climbers, sometimes from afar, conquer the great walls of ice.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally La Grave is stunning; it is useless to search for the typical wooden chalets usually associated with the French Alps here. In this authentic town the small chalets that you can imagine are huddling together to keep warm, are all constructed from stone.\r\n\r\nFor food lovers, the local speciality at party season in Villar d'Arene and La Grave is a wonderful sort of cabbage tart/quiche. Other specialities in the ‘Pays de la Meije' include ravioli, rissoles (small pies), pognes and crozets (similar to meatballs).\r\n\r\nFinally, ultimately the most famous event that takes place in La Grave: The \"Derby de la Meije\", this legendary race pitches the best skiers and snowboarders against the mountain. Riders come from all over the world to participate. Solo, in a team or disguised: everything goes; the only mission is to get to the bottom first. On the day, there is only really one challenge; to do better than last year! The festive atmosphere that coincides with the event is fantastic; great food, street performances and live music.",

When you go skiing in Wengen you might also like to take the mountain railway up to the Jungfraujoch – it is not for nothing that this mountain is often called the “roof of Europe”. ",

  "name":"Kandersteg",
    "description":"Kandersteg is a picturesque, traditional village with a long, long history in the midst of stunning Alpine scenery.  It has maintained its relaxed and friendly character through centuries of hosting guests, first traders and for the past few centuries, tourists - for the last 100 years in winter as well as summer.   It's location with a short easy transfer from Swiss capital Berne is an added bonus.\n\nThe village grew up at the northern end of the trade route from Italy over the Simplon Pass, which was busy for millenia.  It was dangerous too and eventually the poor farmers of the area built the village church which still stands today from 1510 partly in order to give travellers a place to pray before and after making the Alpine crossing.  \nThe church bell was cast in 1541 and is still used to ring in the New Year.\n\nTourism began some two centuries ago after a visiting doctor wrote of his experiences of the beauty of the area and the healthiness and good nature of the inhabitants.  At that time in the late eighteenth century medical advice was actually against staying in the mountains and mountain air generally believed to be unhealthy.  The doctor's review, along with improved access and facilities led to a growth in tourists.\n\nIn the summer of 1860, two Englishmen, a vicar and a doctor and an American arrived in Kandersteg and asked for a guide to take them to the top of the Blümlisalp (3663 m above sea level). The young Fritz Ogi was the only person with enough courage to take the job. He became the founder of a mountain guide dynasty.\n\nThe latter half of the twentieth century were boom years for Kandersteg bringing true stability and some prosperity to the locals for the first time.  New hotels were built.   Mark Twain stayed in the village for the night of August 23rd, 1878 and then hiked over the Gemmi Pass. His humorous but accurate account of his journey can be found in his book A Tramp Abroad. The guest book at mountain guest house and restaurant Schwarenbach half-way across the Gemmi Pass has inscriptions from many famous personalities such as Alexander Dumas, Picasso and Lenin.\n\nWinter sports began more than a century ago, visitors initially attracted for the curling, but they have never really been the all encompassing attraction that they are at many other top ski centres.  Kandersteg has far more to offer than many ski centres and a much greater proportion of its clientele visits, year round, for the hiking, fishing, flora and fauna or just the stunning scenery than is the ski resort norm. \n",

The 10 lifts cover a maximum of terrain and the altitude (the top station is at more than 2.800 meters) ensures snow safety.\r\nThe views over the swiss alps are breath taking and there are fantastic ski-touring opportunities starting at P&eacute;z Ault. From here you can also take the 12KM long slope down to the valley that will have your legs burning. Stretching across 1.700 vertical meters there are mostly steep slopes with a fair amount of easy options mixed in.\r\nOffpiste you need to be aware that the resort is not marking nor checking the terrain, so you need to use your own judgement. In order to be on the safe side, there are several LVS-checkpoints and there also is an avalanche-training area at \"Bar Nevada\" where you can train searching for buried beacon signals under real conditions.\r\nLast but not least Disentis is also close to other resorts, so there are plenty of opportunities to keep you riding and happy for days on end.",

  "name":"Engadin St. Moritz",
    "description":"So which is the world's most famous ski resort?  Opinions remain divided and a truly international poll of public opinion has not yet been carried out.  North American candidates would possibly be lead by Aspen with Vail and Stowe in contention or even the modern number one, Whistler.  In Europe there's St Anton, Kitzbühel, Chamonix, Val d'Isère and perhaps half a dozen more, but given a mix of the ski world and the general public, wouldn't St Moritz come out top?  \r\nWhether or not it is the best well known for the correct reasons is debatable, it's famous for being the playground of the rich and famous and for being a touch expensive, both of which remain largely true.  On the other hand it's not well known for having great skiing, which it does.  Some may also imagine it to be a quaint Alpine village, which it isn't, although the lakeside setting in the Engadin Valley is stunning.  It is also not generally reported that, although a genuine traditional settlement, St Moritz is a high altitude resort with an excellent snow record and glacier skiing.  Finally it should be mentioned that whilst many other famous names from skiing history have contented themselves to rest on their reputation, St Moritz and the Engadin Region have invested heavily in state of the art lifts and are now served by a host of high speed detachable quad and six seat chair lifts.  Oh and the sun shines 322 days a year, Switzerland's sunniest spot.  \r\nSt Moritz can claim to be the birth place of winter sports holidays.  In 1864 the owner of the Kulm hotel bet some English tourists a free stay if they dared to spend the winter there.  They took him up on this proposition and the rest  is history.  St Moritz was reported in The Times of London a few years later when a guest recorded with surprise the flowers in the hotel window boxes on Christmas Day.  By 1910 around 2000 guests spent the winter in the resort, most from Britain.  \r\nSkating remained the most popular winter sport until the 1920s, with skiing dismissed as a serious sport by the locals, but then came the 1928 Winter Olympics and a new mountain funicular railway, followed soon after by Switzerland's second ski lift.  The fifth Winter Olympics were staged in the resort once again in 1948.  Later the rich and famous who flocked to St Moritz helped to develop the possibilities of glacier skiing on the Diavolezza glacier and later heli-skiing. In fact the resort can claim a long list of 'firsts' from opening Switzerland's first tourist board in 1864 and switching on the country's first electric light in 1878 to staging the first ice skating, curling and winter sports championships in the 1880s and even Europe's first golf tournament in 1890. \r\nSt Moritz was the first resort to register its name and logo, in 1987. Finally, it must be noted that St Moritz's fame as a health resort does pre-date winter sports by several millennia. The first settlements are known to have existed here 3,000 years ago and the resort was also one of the world's earliest spa centres, well known as such by the time the Romans rolled in in 15 BC. ",

There are also some suitable freeride runs for trying off-piste.\r\nAdvanced skiers&nbsp;do have some black runs but perhaps more appealing is the wealth of off-piste terrain and the challenging freeride runs (which vary a lot in diificulty).\r\nWhat&rsquo;s the resort like?&nbsp;The resort is divided into Laax, Flims and Falera. Generally speaking Laax is more modern and lively while Flims is quieter and more traditional. Some of the villages, including Flims Waldhaus, offer efficient ski buses.\r\nOff the slopes?&nbsp;Ice skating at the sports centre in Flims, make huge jumps at the Freestyle Academy, enjoy a game of ice hockey at Prau la Selva sports centre or take the kids to Laax Swimming Pool.\r\nDownside?&nbsp;The sunny slopes mean snow conditions can be a little hit and miss in the spring.

    "description":"At the heart of the Jura region of France, the Haut-Jura nature reserve. Four villages which are dotted about in the reserve have come together and created a modern yet authentic ski area. The villages of Les Rousses, Prémanon, Lamoura and Bois d'Amont make up the area, which borders with Switzerland. The small resort which stretches from 1120 to 1680 metres in altitude is an ideal place to get away from the hustle and bustle of modern life and enjoy some unspoilt nature.\r\n\r\nThanks to its position on the French-Swiss border Les Rousses offers no less than 5 alpine ski areas:\r\n- The Franco-Swiss ski area (30 marked ski runs): Is made up of Dole Massif (Switzerland) and the Tuffes Massif (in France). There is a specially built linking ski run between the two resorts.\r\n- The Tuffes ski area (13 marked ski runs) above the town of Prémanon is well regarded and has three different access points (Jouvencelles, Balancier and Darbella). The resort has everything a modern ski resort should have and everything is in reach by ski. It is a truly delightful ski area for families.\r\n- The Serra ski area (13 marked ski runs) is above the town of Lamoura. The area has recently been improved and upgraded with a newly installed chairlift and new ski runs.\r\n- The Noirmont ski area (10 marked ski runs), the most popular in the Haut-Jura range, is above the town of Les Rousses and has the Franco-Swiss border at mid-height of the resort. The ski slopes are set to delight skiers out looking for hair raising adventure and speed. \r\n- The Bellefontaine ski area (3 marked ski runs): This area is ideal for families who are just beginning to learn to ski. The reduced size of the area compared with the others lends itself to safely being able to teach children how to ski. Reduced in scope compared to other areas of the resort, its slopes are ideal for skiing with the family.\r\n\r\nFor the younger generation Les Rousses ski resort has 3 bordercross courses: \r\n- A bordercross course accessible to all on the Serra blue slope\r\n- A bordercross course on the Entreroche blue slope (Bellefontaine ski area) \r\n- In the Tuffes Massive (Jouvencelles) there is a natural bordercross course (take the Jouvenceaux chairlift) \r\n(Worth a note as well that there are also two snow parks in Tuffes and in Serra. Equipped with various rails and boxes) \r\n\r\nLes Rousses is one of the largest ski areas in France, offering over 220 kilometres of regularly groomed ski runs.\r\nSpread across 6 different areas, the cross country skiing in Les Rousses varies in difficulty, setting enough of a challenge for experts but also areas for beginners to start out. \r\n\r\nThe gentle landscape of the Haut-Jura lends itself particularly well to snowshoeing. Les Rousses ski resort has:\r\n- 18 Km of groomed snowshoe trails (access fee)\r\n- 50 Km of marked snowshoe trails (free access)\r\n- 10,000 hectares of virgin snow for freely snowshoeing around\r\n\r\nLes Rousses has several different solutions for the care of your children:\r\n- The Crèche \"Les Petits Randonneurs (Small Hikers)\" in Prémanon (children 3 months to 4 years)\r\n- The Lamoura Recreation centre \"Les P'tits Boulis\" (for children 3 to 12 years)\r\n- The Les Rousses day-care (for children 3 months to 6 years)\r\n- The “Francas” recreation centre specialising in local woodcraft (for children 3 to 11 years)\r\n- The “Jacobeys” recreation centre (for ages 5 to 13 years).",

It has a long standing reputation as a climatic health resort.\n\nSkiing at HochSchneeberg above Puchberg is largely thanks to the laborious construction of a funicular railway up from the village more than 110 years ago.  The first scheduled train chugged into the Baumgartner station on June 1, 1897. Meanwhile, work on the upper rail section continued at a rapid pace, and on September 22, 1897 the entire stretch of railway was opened for use. A masterful feat of technology had been accomplished. \n\nSkiers can access two lifts, a chair or a drag lift, on what is Lower Austria's highest mountain, and which like the funicular railway have a salamander theme.  These access five miles of runs graded easy or intermediate.",

Cervinia is located on the Italian side of the iconic Matterhorn Mountain and skiing over to neighbouring Zermatt on the Swiss side is also possible, offering a combined 322km of slopes, linked with fast, modern lifts.\r\nBest suited to?&nbsp;Beginners and intermediates are spoilt for choice with endless long blue and red runs. Cervinia is also popular with freestyle fans who flock to the Indian terrain park (1.2km long, 200m wide and 11 features).\r\nWhat's the resort like?&nbsp;The small, car-free village has a pretty centre with charaterful cobbled streets and stylish Italian boutiques. It is popular with famillies and there's a good choice of ski-in/ski-out accommodation thanks to the reliable snowfall. Nighlife in Cervinia isn't too raucous, but livens up considerably at weekends with live music, djs and cocktails.\r\nThe views from the Italian side of the border are phenomenal which is not at all surprising considering that the resort is set in a jagged&nbsp;high-altitude basin in the middle of the Matterhorn and Piccolo Cervino (Klein Matterhorn).\r\nNon-skiing activities: Not many non-skiing activities, but plenty of sunny terraces on which to take in the dramatic scenery and enjoy afternoon drinks.\r\nDownside?&nbsp;There's not a huge amount for more advanced skiers/snowboarders to get their teeth into. High winds and low cloud can sometimes hamper conditions.\r\nNearest airport: Turn (121km/90 minutes)",

The skiing extends almost up to 3000 metres and there are spectacular views across Aosta Valley and Piemonte.  \n\nThe ski area was 'reborn' for the 2003/4 season when the spectacular Funifor cable car finally completed the long planned link in the circuit between the Valsesia and Gressoney La Trinite resorts (themselves connected to Champoluc).\n\nThe most internationally famous resort on the circuit, Alagna, is known for its old world charm and having been preserved from cement with its Walser buildings dominant.  It was founded in the 12th century and is built around the local parish church.  Although there's skiing for all standards, Alagna remains a haven for expert skiers, the village sits beneath one of the world's greatest lift-served verticals skiable by many off-piste descents.\n\nAt the other extreme of the pass, Champoluc at 1570m is the main resort in the Val d'Ayas.  Surrounded by pine woods, it offers spectacular views of the Monte Rosa glaciers and the rocky buttresses of Mont Sarezza and the Testa Grigia.\n\nAntagnod above at 1710m also has spectacular views as well as well preserved old buildings, including the famous maison Fournier once the stronghold of the counts of Challant.  \n\nBetween them Gressoney La Trinite - which is linked to the Monte Rosa circuit and Gressoney St Jean beneath it, which isn't.  The architecture is again beautiful, with chalet style buildings and again spectacular views.\n",

    "description":"Bardonecchia, with over 100 km of slopes and 23 ski lifts, is made up two ski areas. On one side there's the area that includes Colomion, Les Arnauds and Melezet, which is characteristized by wide slopes that cut through the forest. A thick and artistic spider web of slopes connects Campo Smith (1330 m) in the center of town to the vast plateaus of Vallon Cros, which at 2400 m of altitude is above the treeline.\r\n\r\nFive minutes from downtown, connected via a free skibus, is the Jafferau resort (highest point 2800 m). Here most of the slopes are out of the forest which allows for an unparalleled view of the surrounding mountains and infinite possibilities of off trail itineraries in the spring.\r\n\r\nJafferau is famous for having hosted all of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympic snowboarding events at the Melezet snowpark.\r\n\r\nBardonecchia is easy to reach by car or by train, thanks to the train station located just a few hundred meters from the slopes. There's something for everyone and the fact that it's a real mountain town makes it a perfect destination for a fun and relaxing family vacation filled with sports, nature and good food.",

The town also offers access to the Maneggio area, dedicated to beginners. The Riserva Bianca (White reserve) can satisfy downhill skiing enthusiasts thanks to its 80 km of runs covered almost entirely by artificial snow systems and served by 16 lift systems, with stat-of-the-art telecabins and chair-lifts. The tracks vary in length and difficulty, with some runs designed for beginners and others which have hosted, among other things, the training sessions of the Italian and French national teams. The width of the runs makes them ideal for use by snowboarders, while those boarders who prefer to practise their acrobatic moves can do so in the 3500 square metres of the snowpark at Limonetto, equipped with half pipe, kickers, box and rails. A play park on the snow, with entertainment for young children can be found at Quota 1400, while numerous restaurant-chalets scattered across the slopes offer an excellent opportunity to relax, maybe enjoying the valley’s specialities.\r\nLimone and Val Vermenagna also make the most of cross-country skiing, with two centres dedicated to this discipline, one at Panice Sottana and another at Vernante, which have approximately 9 and 10 km of tracks respectively. The valley also attracts large numbers of ski touring enthusiasts as it is able to offer numerous excursions of varying length and difficulty, on famous slopes and peaks: from Cima Fascia to Vallone San Giovanni with Cima Pepino, from which one can enjoy an enchanting view of the Piemonte plain, the Ligurian Sea and Corsica, from Rocca dell’Abisso to Monte Chiamossero and to Monte Creusa, descending into Val Grande di Vernante.\r\n\r\n",

    "description":"For skiers, freeriders and ski touring enthusiasts, the kilometres of snow-covered slopes that surmount the Macugnaga basin definitely represent a delightful opportunity to try and endless range of different descents and excursions. It is possible to reach the top either by taking advantage of the heliski service or using the cableway that links Alpe Bill to the Moro Pass that travels into Switzerland, situated at an altitude of 2796 m. This system is part of the Monte Moro ski district which – at an altitude of almost 3000 m – offers the chance to test your skills against the very technical and difficult tracks of the Roccette or to descend the 7.5 km of the Meccia to reach Alpe Bill, skiing through a difference in altitude of over 1000 m. Just as interesting are the descents of the second district of Macugnaga, the Burky-Belvedere, positioned inside the basin, between the town and the impressive massif of the Rosa. A two-branch chair-lift leads from the hamlet of Pecetto to the 1613 m of the Burky and then to the 1932 of the Belvedere. The ski runs that link these last two localities are classed as some of the most beautiful in Macugnaga and have been chosen in the past as training ground for the Italian women’s skiing team.\r\nCross-country skiing is practiced on two tracks which place over 15 km of runs at the disposal of enthusiasts. The Signal track offers an ideal itinerary for skiing in peace in an enchanting setting. It is situated in Pecetto and bypasses the last chalets of the hamlet before climbing towards Monte Rosa to the wooden cross raised up to protect Macugnaga. For those with a desire to cover a difference in altitude, the Frazioni track winds along the whole right bank of the River Anza. The track descends from Pecetto to the picturesque chalets of Isella before climbing back up the slope and entering the Quarazza Valley, amidst the best-preserved territories of Macugnaga. Considerable attention is also dedicated to snowboarding. The main area is the Pink Snowpark of Monte Moro, at an altitude of 2800 m, which stays open until May. It has two different lines of jumps for beginners and professionals, a snowboard house and a sound system that pipes music throughout the whole park. Smaller areas are set up every year both in Burky and at the Sports Centre in town.\r\n\r\n",

For nature lovers moreover, 300 metres from the intermediate stop of the cableway in the hamlet Alpino, we suggest to visit the Botanical Garden Alpinia with over 500 essences, unique of its kind for the typology of its plants, solely of alpine origin. \r\n",

The Grand Hotel Astoria is a classic.  \n\nThe White Highlands of Folgaria, Lavarone and Luserna in Italy's Trentiono region are becoming a favourite haunt with snowboarders. Not least because a new snow-park has been added to the existing Fondo Grande park in Folgaria. The new area dedicated to snowboarding acrobatics is situated in Lavarone, or more precisely at Malga Rivetta, on the other side of the Forti ski carousel. \n\nThe Turismo Lavarone Lifts Association, in collaboration with the White Crows Snowboarding Club which provided technical know-how, has set up the park aimed at all ability levels.  \n\nIts many special features make this park both unique and innovative. Beginning with the challenging rails of several different types, from straight double pipes (two parallel rails) to single pipes, and the rainbow, the pyramid and the king, which present varying non linear shapes. \n\nParticularly interesting are the three fun boxes: square raised platforms that allow riders to jump up and down from all four sides. Naturally there are also small and medium sized springboards used for air acrobatics.\n\nAs in the rest of the Altipiani di Folgaria, Lavarone e Luserna ski area, at Malga Rivetta too those who wish to try their hand at acrobatic snowboarding can hire all the necessary equipment , also for a less challenging practise of this discipline on the traditional slopes. For beginners lessons are available with the skilled instructors of the Lavarone Ski School.",

Its 66 lifts, which include 20 high-speed detachable quad and six-seater chairlifts, along with three gondolas, give a combined uplift of more than 100,000 skiers per hour &ndash; a combination of speed and capacity matched by less than a dozen resorts worldwide. It is also now one of the planet&rsquo;s biggest and most modern snow-makers with more than half of its terrain covered by 1,000 snow cannons.\r\nWhile you can still find low-priced apartments, the range of quality accommodation on offer is a rather new thing. The best of the slope-side hotels is the five-star&nbsp;Hermitage&nbsp;and nearby&nbsp;Sporthotel&nbsp;in central Soldeu.\r\nGrandvalira continues to retain a hardcore party reputation, particularly at the resort of Pas de la Casa.&nbsp;It has a compact centre with a dozen or so small-to-medium sized bars in each. Service by English or Antipodean bar staff is the order of the day, with prices equivalent to those 'back home' or better, so they're lively as soon as the lifts close.\r\nAndorra doesn&rsquo;t have its own airport. The biggest airport is Barcelona (210 Km) and the nearest is l&rsquo;Alguaire de Lleida (158 Km). Girona (250 Km) and Reus (210 Km) are two other options. From here you can get to Andorra by car or bus. From France, the main airports are Rivesaltes airport (170 Km) in Perpignan and Blagnac airport in Toulouse, (196 Km).",

The resort also boasts the country's greatest vertical, most runs and longest run ( 3km ).  Many of the higher slopes are above the tree-line, which is unusual for Finnish skiing.  The slopes are 4km from the resort, although you can nearly ski all the way back and in any case there is a free ski bus link.  The sun does not rise in winter until late January, when temperatures can be as low as -15ºC although there is adequate daylight,  Children get free rental equipment and lift tickets so long as they wear a helmet when skiing.\n",

Indeed the resort is a collection of villages spread around the lake and the skiing is on separate mountains - Kobla and Vogel, at each end of the Lake.  Located in the Triglav National Park, Bohinj also has a glacier above although the ski lifts do not reach it. \n\nThe mountain scenery of the Julian Alps is spectacular and snow conditions are often the best in the country as moisture from the Adriatic hits these mountains first as it travels inland.\n\nThe largest village in the area is Bohinjska Bistrica which is at the base of the skiing at Kobla which extends for a vertical kilometre above the village.  Kobla is the only ski resort in Slovenia accessible by train. \n\nAt the other end of the Lake a cable car lifts skiers up to 1544m where most of the skiing begins, in a narrow range up to 1800m.  However there is a long red right back down to the Lake at 570m, snow permitting.\n\nKobla has slightly more marked piste than Vogel, the two areas together have about 60km of runs.\n",

    "description":"Fast access from the main urban centers of Catalonia (1.5 hours from Barcelona), the ski resort of Port del Comte is located in the region of Solson&egrave;s (Lleida) in the Catalan Pyrenees. It is a popular destination for families and is particularly appreciated by all skiers looking for outdoor activities, nature and sports.The plebiscite of the Port del Comte families for its wide paths traced through the forest of black pines (this is also one of the characteristics of the complex). From the wide area for beginners to the very busy black slopes, the ski area of Port des Comte is ideal for everyone, from beginner skiers to freeriders ...Divided into two distinct sectors (Hostal-Sucre-B&ograve;fia and Estivella Area), the ski area in general benefits from good snowfall resulting from negative temperatures combined with rainfall emanating from the Mediterranean influence. This natural snow also has the backing of a powerful network of snow culture that guarantees the quality of the snow and the return of the ski stations to the feet throughout the season.The area totals 50 kilometers of tracks divided into 7 green, 11 blue, 13 red and 6 black. It extends between the snow front (at 1700 meters altitude) and the summit of the Estivella sector (beyond 2300 m).Since the 2000s, a vast investment and renovation plan has literally transformed the Port del Comte resort. We emphasize, the replacement of the old ski lifts by more comfortable and fast chairlifts, the establishment of carpets for beginners, the installation of high pressure poles for the production of the snow culture, the improvement and the accesses of asphalting and parking, tracks of remodeling and grass, etc. These investments, year after year, contribute to the renovation and modernization of the complex and customer satisfaction.Port del Comte now offers all the facilities and services that one \"is entitled\" to expect from a ski resort: 3 ski schools, a snow park, snowshoe / dog trails, tents (rental and sale of ski equipment). skiing, snowboarding and accessories), restaurants, snow garden, medical center ...In addition to skiing, Port del Comte offers a wide range of activities, both for children and adults: you can take long snowshoe walks on the many itineraries while enjoying the breathtaking scenery. The adventure park is also a must-see with its acrobatic circuit through which you will have to overcome the various obstacles between the trees. Another alternative: the snowtubing that allows you to follow the descents perched on a large buoy that slides along a giant slide of snow.",

The resort is located about 49 miles (78km) south of Marrakech and is the highest ski resort in Africa. Standing at over 3,000 metres (over 9,500 feet) and offering up to 10km of skiable slopes, visitors are a mix of both tourists and local skiers.<br><br>There are seven lifts in Oukaïmeden that run for all abilities, including six drag-lifts that service the beginner’s nursery slope and the intermediate-level slopes; and a slow single chairlift to the more advanced slope. The intermediate slopes are much more attractive and have fairly tamed conditions, but the difficulty of each run varies a lot depending on the hill. At the bottom of the lifts, you will find a well-kept nursery slope that provides a better environment for beginner’s-level skiing, together with a large family sledding area.<br><br>The resort offers a small selection of runs, with the longest being just over 2 miles (3km), and the runs from the top of the chairlift being the most challenging. This is where the snow can feel like hard off-piste ice in some sections as you descend. These runs are not particularly easy and are best suited to high-intermediate to advanced-level skiers.",

    "description":"Morocco is known by exotic-skiing cognoscenti as the best skiing destination in Africa, but the high, snow-catching slopes of the Atlas Mountains extend from Morocco into Algeria as well. It was here, 43 miles south of the capital city of Algiers in the Tell Atlas subrange, that French colonialists established Africa’s first ski area in the 1940s. Sitting at 5,000 feet in what is now Chréa National Park, the Chréa ski area may have only had 295 feet of vertical drop, but the Atlas cedar forest was beautiful, a welcoming Tudor lodge awaited at the base, and every weekend its slopes filled with French skiers and their families.<br><brBut Chréa had a secret. Unbeknownst to the French, the mountain was also a clandestine base for independence fighters who were plotting for their country’s freedom. Their victory came in 1962, when Algeria won its independence. The French promptly left en masse, abandoning their beloved ski area. Algerians, however, quickly learned to love the foreign sport, maintaining the ski area and even installing a four-and-a-half-mile gondola to Chréa from the nearby city of Bilda in 1984.<br><br>Except Chréa’s time as a conflict zone wasn’t over. An Algerian civil war erupted in 1992, and the little ski area became a military base once again, this time housing the radical Armed Islamic Group. When the war ended in 2002, the lodge and lifts had been destroyed. Skiing in Algeria was over, or so it seemed.<br><br>Then the Algerian government and ski community began rebuilding. A rope tow on Chréa’s main run was restored. The rebuilt gondola from Bilda returned to operation in 2009. Locals built handmade tea stands at the base. Local youth signed up for the revived Algerian national race team, and one skier even went to the Vancouver Olympics in 2010. Today, Chréa is back and Algeria is a skiing country once again.",

The Nozawa Onsen Ski Resort almost takes a bit of a backseat relative to the charming village that offers an interesting and traditional Japanese experience. The village is famous for the abundance of hot springs that were discovered in the 8th century. Steam rises up everywhere amongst the bustling narrow cobblestone streets and the traditional ryokan inns and shops. The culture of Nozawa Onsen skiing is also historic. Skiing was introduced to Nozawa Onsen Japan in 1912 by an Austrian, and it is considered by some to be the birthplace of skiing in Japan. These days, the Nozawa Onsen Ski Resort is one of the most popular ski resorts in Japan for international travellers due to its diversity of terrain, abundance of snow, the lovely traditional village, its family friendliness, and because English speaking guests are well catered for.",

Considering the few information found online, a restaurant should be located in one of the building at the bottom of the resort.
